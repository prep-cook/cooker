# Internal stream reference (S0 decisions and S1 contracts)

## 1. Purpose and scope

Define the sole internal representation for cooker inference: a Chat Completions-based, versioned SSE grammar covering requests, streamed and buffered responses, count_tokens, compact, legacy completions, Responses HTTP/WebSocket, Anthropic Messages, Gemini generation/Interactions, images, speech, video, realtime/Live, Codex alpha search and AI Studio relay inference traffic. All client and upstream boundaries decode/encode, including same-protocol traffic; no raw-byte bypass exists. Only management/dashboard, health/root, model discovery, OAuth callbacks, authentication/ephemeral-key issuance, transport handshakes and already-unimplemented operations are outside inference conversion. Authentication and transport remain boundary responsibilities; SDP, session commands and media content are inside. Current route evidence: `crates/ck-server/src/lib.rs:60-101`, `crates/ck-server/src/realtime/api.rs:79-106`, `crates/ck-server/src/inference/codex_alpha.rs:22-25`, `crates/ck-server/src/realtime/aistudio_relay.rs:49-59`; current transcription/translation/SIP stubs: `crates/ck-server/src/realtime/api.rs:12`. This is a normative target, not a claim of implementation. Current-code citations refer to post-W1 master `b518060ea1e43ef4b266591986ca92321e6289b5`.

## 2. Decisions

MUST/SHOULD/MAY have RFC 2119 meanings. Unlabelled requirements below specify this grammar, not additional owner quotations.
`Settled` means `docs/OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`, "Settled"; `Q` means the S0 question list (https://paste.gentoozh.org/md/r-Ncm2jUEeb.md). Defaults were set on 2026-11-13 by the maintainers after the owners asked them to proceed.
The specification supersedes contrary suggestions in the earlier review and unanswered-question wording; those are not competing contracts.
The maintainer defaults B1-B9, C2, D1, D3 and F, and the pool-lifetime reading of G4, stand as settled defaults: the owner accepted them on 2026-11-14 with no further questions (Settled 43). A later owner ruling may still revise a row. Interoperability requirements govern every implementation; mechanisms labelled **S1 choice** bind S1 only, with rationale beside each choice.

| Subject | Status | Decision | Source |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A1–A4 | Settled | Chat chunk base; `x_ck` JSON plus named events; one version; unknown fields/events reach egress intact. | Settled |
| Conversion | Settled | Every ingress/egress converts, including same-protocol; replace pairwise paths without compatibility shims. | Settled |
| Non-SSE | Settled | Custom-data chunks ≤50 KB; collection delay ≤100 ms. | Settled; §3.4 |
| Storage | Settled | mmap files, fixed blocks, positions only; no heap storage of stream data. | Settled; §6.1 |
| Frame size | Settled | Storage frames are 50,000 bytes, the non-SSE chunk size. | Owner ruling 2026-11-13 (G1′) |
| Full storage | Settled | One cache queue holds all stream bytes. Under size pressure the stream read least recently goes first; a stream not read for 1 h expires. Disk-full/other edges best effort. | Settled; owner ruling 2026-11-14 (Settled 41, §6.4) |
| Plugins | Settled | Plugins are deleted; extension means modifying the source and rebuilding. See §8. | Owner ruling 2026-11-13 |
| G2 | Settled | Default directory `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cooker/` (tmpfs); configurable (§6.3). | Owner ruling 2026-11-13 |
| G3 | Settled | One preallocated mmap pool file per process, 50,000-byte frames. Padded per-thread LIFO free lists, 128-byte-aligned shared counters, per-stream frame table. The committed length lives in a per-stream header slot in the pool; allocator metadata tracks the pool's backed frame count (§6.1). Grow with `fallocate` and check its result; an `ftruncate`-only grow turns tmpfs exhaustion into SIGBUS. Per-request files cost -94% req/s on 2 KiB requests sequentially and -99% at 64 tasks (`mmap`/`munmap` lock and TLB shootdown); the pool matches or beats heap in every measured row except one that is still open (§6.1, §9.3). | Owner ruling 2026-11-13; shared pool confirmed 2026-11-14 |
| G4/G5 | Settled | Unlink immediately (or O_TMPFILE) where possible; otherwise keep the path until the pool closes, then delete it. No startup sweep (§6.3). The pool-lifetime reading (the path lives until the pool closes) is accepted. | Owner ruling 2026-11-13; reading accepted 2026-11-14 (Settled 43) |
| G6 | Settled | No application encryption; protection comes from OS disk and memory encryption. File 0600, directory 0700 (§6.3). | Owner ruling 2026-11-13 |
| G7 | Settled | Out of pool space or over a limit returns an error; no heap fallback (§6.4). | Owner ruling 2026-11-13 |
| G8 | Settled | Per-stream limit 256 MiB (5,368 frames); pool total at most 4 GiB (85,899 frames), lowered only by the startup caps in §6.4. | Owner ruling 2026-11-14 (Settled 41) |
| G9 | Settled | Performance tests mount the storage directory on tmpfs; no regression against heap buffering is accepted (§9.3). | Owner ruling 2026-11-13 |
| Exhaustion/platform | Settled | Visible failure, no degradation; Linux server only. | Settled; §6.4, §10 |
| B1 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Claude signatures remain bound to their thinking block. | Q |
| B2 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Redacted thinking has its own opaque event. | Q |
| B3 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Gemini signatures remain part-bound, including signature-only parts. | Q |
| B4 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Preserve cache TTL buckets; absence ≠ zero; usage snapshots, not deltas. | Q |
| B5 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Logprobs stay in Chat's choice-level location. | Q |
| B6 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Preserve media MIME, bytes, transcript and timing. | Q |
| B7 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Independent choice state; single-choice destinations emit choice 0, debug-log dropped indexes. | Q |
| B8 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Tools have start/argument-delta/end; whole calls become one argument delta. | Q |
| B9 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Grounding/code execution/URL context are named events; unsupported egress drops with debug logs. | Q |
| C2 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Invalid textual UTF-8: client 400; upstream error; binary media is not text. | Q |
| D1 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Configurable stream limits; event and metadata sizes start with the §6.4 provisional values, replace after measurement. Cache size and cache age are owner numbers (G8, Settled 41), not defaults. | Q |
| D2 | Settled | The gateway buffers like a router: a slow client never pauses upstream reads; upstream bytes are collected into the pool and relayed at the client's pace. Buffered bytes are ordinary cache entries: they follow the same 1 h no-read expiry and least-recent-read eviction as every other byte (G8). Exceeding the per-stream limit fails the stream visibly (G7). Leased frames are never overwritten. | Owner ruling 2026-11-14; reconciled by Settled 41 |
| Further details | Settled | Any detail this spec does not cover follows the observed behaviour of the keeper component of AI-gateway, pinned at commit `b49ad9ac6c1eb65b1785d66ecb7249413d4c82bf` of https://github.com/xz-dev/openai-api-cache-keeper (the submodule of https://github.com/xz-dev/AI-gateway). It is a behaviour reference; its code is not copied. Later keeper changes are adopted only by updating this pin. | Owner ruling 2026-11-14 (Settled 43) |
| Resume | Settled | A client disconnect never cancels, releases or cleans a stream: upstream collection continues and the bytes stay cached, so a reconnecting client resumes from its last delivered position (§6.6). | Owner ruling 2026-11-14 (Settled 42) |
| D3 | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | No failover after the first event producing client-deliverable bytes. | Q |
| F | Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14) | Measure first, obtain owner-approved thresholds; use §9 commands and codec metrics. | Q |

### 2.1 S1 responsibility and dependency contract

Phase B introduces `ck-stream` and its dependency-table row together, without production inference callers. `crates/AGENTS.md` remains the only input to `tools/check-crate-deps.py`; consuming edges are added with their cutover phases.

| Owner | S1 responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `ck-stream` | Grammar views, positions, pool, publication, leases, cache and bounded semantic state. No workspace dependencies, HTTP, credentials, provider selection or durable state. |
| `ck-core` | Configuration, credential and model types. No dependency on `ck-stream` or `ck-exec`. |
| `ck-wire` | Boundary helpers; depends only on `ck-core` among workspace crates. |
| `ck-translate` | Ingress/egress codecs and destination capability validation; may use `ck-core`, `ck-wire`, `ck-stream`. No provider execution. |
| `ck-exec` | Execution envelopes, provider transports, authentication and preparation; may use `ck-core`, `ck-wire`, `ck-stream`, `ck-translate`. Move inference envelopes out of `ck-core`; remove old re-exports and executor-side pair translation. |
| `ck-server` | Client boundaries, scheduling, authenticated resume and runtime-owned work; may use `ck-core`, `ck-wire`, `ck-stream`, `ck-translate`, `ck-exec`. |
| `cooker` | Bootstrap. Keep its current dependencies; add `ck-stream` only if the binary directly uses it. |

Use the existing provider selector in `crates/ck-exec/src/lib.rs:164-184`. Executor dispatch stays static; no per-event trait boxing or second provider registry. In the post-W1 layout, stream ownership/resume belongs under `crates/ck-server/src/inference/`; egress belongs beside `http/respond.rs`. Runtime and listener integration belong under `runtime/` and `net/listener.rs`.

## 3. Stream grammar

### 3.1 Framing and base chunk

Every record is UTF-8 SSE: optional `event: NAME\n`, optional `id: SEQUENCE\n`, exactly one `data: JSON\n`, then `\n`.
The unnamed/default event is a Chat chunk; extension event names start `x_ck.`. Emit LF; boundary parsers accept LF, CRLF and CR.
Ingress SSE joins multiple `data:` lines with LF, observes empty-event boundaries, and validates text across fragmented network reads.
Internal JSON has no literal newlines outside strings, duplicate object keys or non-finite numbers. Reject ambiguous duplicate-key input rather than silently selecting a value.
An external event's `id`, `retry`, comments and unrecognized SSE fields are preserved in `X.source.sse`, including on the terminal record that becomes `done`; a buffered destination without an SSE carrier reports their loss; internal SSE `id`, when present, equals `X.seq`.
Transport keepalive comments become heartbeat metadata if needed; internal heartbeats are named events. Internal `[DONE]` is forbidden; boundary codecs translate it to/from terminal events.

```text
ChatEvent = {
  id: string, object: "chat.completion.chunk", created: integer, model: string,
  choices: [{index: uint, delta: object, finish_reason: string|null,
             logprobs?: object|null, ...unknown_choice_fields}],
  usage?: ChatUsage, system_fingerprint?: string|null, service_tier?: string,
  x_ck: X, ...unknown_chat_fields
}
NamedEvent = {x_ck: X, ...payload_fields_from_the_registry}
```

`id` is the response identifier, not the gateway request identifier; preserve a supplied value, synthesize only when absent.
`created` is Unix seconds; retain any higher-resolution original timestamp in `X.source`. `model` is the effective externally mapped model, not a credential identity.
`delta` retains Chat fields, including role, content, refusal, reasoning_content, tool_calls, audio and annotations; media bytes use §3.4 rather than a second inline copy.
One canonical Chat event carries at most one choice and one item/block/tool delta; split multi-choice/multi-part source events in source order.
Usage-only/base-metadata chunks may have `choices: []`. Choice-level `logprobs` may accompany text/refusal or stand alone with `delta: {}` and `finish_reason: null`; preserve the choice index and supplied item/block correlation without fabricating text or opening a text block.
A finish-only chunk has `delta: {}` and a non-null `finish_reason`; native reasons remain separately available.

### 3.2 The `x_ck` object

`X` denotes this object; `?` denotes absence allowed, not implicit null. Integers used for counters are unsigned 64-bit unless specified otherwise.
Local identifiers are ASCII strings of at most 64 bytes; preserve unrestricted provider identifiers separately in `source.ids`.
The source protocol is provenance; internal routing, scheduling, accounting and in-process stages MUST NOT branch on protocol wire shapes.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `v` | integer, required, `1` | This grammar version, shared by chunks, named events and requests. |
| `request_id`, `stream_id` | local ID, required | One gateway request/turn; one unidirectional logical event stream. |
| `attempt` | uint, required | Routing attempt; changes before failover, never after downstream commitment. |
| `seq` | uint, required | Starts at 0, strictly increases by one in the published stream. |
| `direction` | `request` or `response`, required | Duplex sessions use separate ordered streams per direction. |
| `choice_index` | uint? | Required for choice-scoped named events; equals the Chat choice index when present. |
| `item_id`, `tool_call_id`, `media_id` | local ID? | Stable internal identities; never substitute one for another. |
| `block_index` | uint? | Logical content/thinking/part index within an item; not a frame number. |
| `tool_index` | uint? | Chat tool index within a choice; independent of content block index. |
| `source` | object? | `{protocol, event?, ids?, sequence?, output_index?, content_index?, summary_index?, part_index?, timestamp?, sse?}`. |
| `source.ids` | object? | Original request/response/item/call/part/session IDs under their original field names. |
| `native_finish_reason` | JSON value? | Exact source stop/status reason, including unknown reasons. |
| `original` | array? | Unmapped field records `{protocol, pointer, value}`; pointer is RFC 6901 within its correlated source object. |
| `synthetic` | array of strings? | Names of generated fields, e.g. `id`, `created`, `item_id`; never pretend they came from upstream. |
| `span` | object? | `{start, end, unit, source_pointer?}`; end-exclusive source offsets, unit `utf8_byte`, `unicode_scalar`, `utf16_code_unit` or `token`. |
| `...` | JSON values | Unknown extension members preserved; only registered fields control execution. |

Every record carries correlation, even when its payload is empty. Source IDs are restored by capable egress, not regenerated on each delta.
For source protocols without item IDs, allocate stable local items at part/block starts; close them at source stops or a validated choice finish.
A signature-only Gemini part gets its own item/block even if it contains no text. Do not attach it to the preceding textual part.

### 3.3 Named-event registry

Every row inherits `X`; fields without `?` are mandatory. “Required” in schema/correlation columns means the named fields must be present; choice/item/block/tool/media abbreviate the corresponding `X` indexes/IDs. `value` is valid JSON, not a serialized JSON string unless the source value was a string.
Native annotation/grounding/code/context payloads remain boundary-only data; supported content and operation semantics use §4 schemas, not protocol-specific body inspection by internal consumers.
The registry is closed for core behavior, open for opaque carriage: an unrecognized name is preserved under §3.7, not executed.

| Event suffix after `x_ck.` | Payload schema | Correlation and purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `request.start` | `{operation: string}` | Begins the request document defined in §4. |
| `request.field` | `{pointer: string, value: JSON}` | Sets one complete field of that logical document; no duplicate path assignment. |
| `request.end` | `{}` | Complete request syntax/schema and destination capability validation succeeded (§4); execution fence. |
| `response.start` | `{id: string, model: string, created: integer, status?: string}` | Response lifecycle; may precede deliverable output. |
| `item.start` | `{kind: string, role?: string, attributes?: object}` | Required item/choice identity; attributes include native item type/status. |
| `item.end` | `{status: "completed"\|"incomplete", attributes?: object}` | Closes an item after all child blocks and tools. |
| `block.start` | `{kind: string, attributes?: object}` | Text, thinking, redacted, function, media or opaque content block. |
| `block.end` | `{}` | Closes the correlated block; no later deltas/signatures for it. |
| `reasoning.signature` | `{kind: "anthropic"\|"gemini"\|"responses_encrypted", fragment: string, final: bool}` | Required choice/item/block; string bytes preserved, no decode/re-sign. |
| `reasoning.redacted` | `{data: string}` | Required choice/item/block; opaque redacted content, not readable reasoning. |
| `tool.start` | `{name: string, kind: "function"\|"custom"\|"server", arguments_format: "json"\|"text", namespace?: string}` | Required choice/item/tool ID/tool index; optional source block. |
| `tool.end` | `{status: "completed"\|"incomplete", valid_json?: bool}` | Completion marker, not another arguments payload. |
| `tool.result` | `{value: JSON, is_error?: bool}` | Correlates historical/request or server-side tool output to the call. |
| `annotation` | `{kind: string, value: JSON}` | Citation/refusal/safety metadata; retain source offsets in `X.span`. |
| `grounding` | `{value: JSON}` | Candidate/item-scoped grounding chunks, supports and search metadata. |
| `code_execution` | `{phase: "code"\|"result", value: JSON}` | Executable code and execution results remain distinct, ordered records. |
| `url_context` | `{value: JSON}` | Retrieval/context metadata with originating choice/item. |
| `usage` | `{usage: UsageSnapshot}` | Attempt-scoped cumulative snapshot (§3.5); optional choice scope. |
| `count_tokens` | `{input_tokens?: uint, total_tokens?: uint, details?: object}` | Count operation result, not generation usage. |
| `compact` | `{item: JSON}` | One ordered compact output item, including encrypted/opaque fields. |
| `media.start` | `{kind: string, mime?: string, encoding: "base64", attributes?: object}` | Required media ID; MIME is absent if unknown, never guessed from modality. |
| `data` | `{index: uint, offset: uint, bytes: string}` | Required media ID; base64 chunk, zero-based chunk index and decoded-byte offset. |
| `media.transcript` | `{text: string, final: bool, timing?: object}` | Media ID; timing retains units, start/end and track/channel information. |
| `media.end` | `{bytes: uint, status: "completed"\|"incomplete"}` | Total decoded byte count; no implicit success on EOF. |
| `operation` | `{kind: string, value: OperationValue}` | Closed semantic variants in §4 for video, search and realtime; unmapped data uses `opaque`. |
| `opaque` | `{name?: string, format: "json"\|"text", value: JSON}` | Source event/field without a registered semantic mapping. |
| `heartbeat` | `{}` | Progress/liveness, never token usage or successful completion. |
| `done` | `{}` | Successful logical stream termination, after final usage and closes. |
| `error` | `{code: string, status: uint, message: string, scope: "client"\|"upstream"\|"resource"}` | Terminal sanitized failure; source detail remains restricted provenance. |
| `cancelled` | `{reason: "client_cancel"\|"shutdown"}` | Terminal cancellation; no fabricated success. A client disconnect is not a cancellation (§6.6), and expiry or eviction ends a stream with `error` `stream.gone`, not `cancelled`. |

Error codes this specification registers: `stream.gone` (status 410, scope `resource`) means the stream expired, was evicted, never existed or belongs to another identity (§6.2, §6.6); `stream.storage_exhausted` (status 503, scope `resource`) means a stream, pool or metadata limit, or ENOSPC, refused an allocation (§6.4, G7); `stream.producer_lost` (status 502, scope `upstream`) means the stream's producer ended without a terminal record: its writer was dropped without finishing the stream (§6.2).

Tool argument deltas use Chat `delta.tool_calls[].function.arguments`; custom text uses the same string slot plus `arguments_format: text` on its start.
The start carries identity/name; a Chat delta may repeat the original source call ID/name for native egress, but repetition is not a new call.
Text and reasoning deltas use Chat `delta.content` and `delta.reasoning_content`; `block.start.kind` distinguishes full reasoning from summaries.
Refusals use Chat `delta.refusal`, with native safety/refusal metadata in annotations. Do not reclassify a blocked answer as an ordinary stop.

### 3.4 Custom data and media

50 KB means 50,000 bytes; KiB means 1,024 bytes. JSON/SSE is textual; arbitrary binary appears only as base64 data chunks.
Use full decoded chunks of 36,864 bytes (49,152 base64 ASCII bytes; 36,864 = 3 × 12,288), with a short chunk on timer, object/message end or cancellation.
The whole encoded `data` event (SSE framing, JSON and base64) MUST NOT exceed 50,000 bytes, the size of one frame. A full chunk leaves 848 bytes (50,000 − 49,152) for framing. When an event's framing would exceed 848 bytes, shorten the decoded chunk to the largest multiple of 3 bytes not above 3 × ⌊(50,000 − framing) / 4⌋. 50,000 raw bytes would require 66,668 base64 bytes before framing and MUST NOT be used.
A complete `data` record MUST fit one frame. It contains only compact common correlation and the three payload fields; emit large source metadata in `media.start`/`opaque`, not every chunk.
Measure collection delay from the first byte of an uncommitted chunk using a monotonic clock; while allocation succeeds, publish within 100 ms or immediately at the chunk ceiling/object end.
A stalled consumer delays transmission, not collection: publish to mmap and keep reading upstream (D2). Allocation failure instead ends the stream with an error event via §6.2 terminal state; it does not extend the timer or permit heap spill.
Preserve MIME, codec, sample rate, channels, dimensions, transcript, source timestamps/timebase, message/packet boundaries and original base64 spelling when semantically relevant metadata requires it.
Binary data bytes are exact after base64 decoding; JSON whitespace, escaping and transport frames are not byte-preservation contracts.
For realtime, `media.start.attributes` names track, packet/message ID, timestamp/timebase and flags; `media.end` closes that packet/message, not the whole session.
Large media values embedded in JSON are decoded incrementally into these chunks, with a media-reference content part instead of a second inline byte copy.

Chat ingress collects a streamed string's input as positions in its input source, not decoded copies, and decodes and publishes it when it fills a data record (28,672 received input bytes, counting an incomplete scalar or escape, so one more 8,192-byte processing step still fits a 36,864-byte chunk), when the string ends, at a flush, or once its 100 ms collection delay has passed; small network pieces therefore share one record instead of costing a frame-aligned record each. An incomplete UTF-8 scalar, JSON escape or base64 quartet remains parser state, not a decoded chunk. Buffered JSON uses this collection path without ending the response before full-body validation; external SSE still requires complete records before response semantics are published.
Request codecs that coalesce ready payload expose its oldest monotonic deadline through `RequestIngress::flush_deadline`, at most 100 ms after collection starts. The owner schedules `flush` even when no network bytes arrive, then rechecks the deadline after every advance or flush. Empty advance has the same flush contract; neither path completes an open media object or request. Later input must not extend an existing deadline. Chat reports the deadline of held string input. Codec objects own no timer task; executor scheduling is part of the later production cutover.
Chat SSE audio uses one media lifetime per choice/item slot, including late native identity and metadata. Ready audio and scalar-text fragments reach streaming egress before choice finish; media end validates the cumulative byte count without replaying content. Complete image/file occurrences remain independent. Trusted response decoding resolves native provenance before topology edits, so removing an already restored leaf cannot recover its old source value during encoding. A removed media carrier makes its later data unreachable. Transformations apply before delivery; Chat cannot retract bytes already sent to a client.
Deleting a media carrier's entire `attributes` object also removes reachability; subsequent data still validates its index and offset but cannot restore the carrier. Removing an image MIME leaves an empty data-URI media type rather than guessing one. A trusted edit that gives an image or document part a non-null URL or `file_data`, or a `file_id` without data, delivers that part with its new source and without the media bytes; audio and scalar text accept only their null payload member. Streaming Chat projections refresh supplied response identity metadata without retaining delta payloads. Opaque text SSE payloads prefix every logical line, including a final empty line, with `data:`. Streaming Chat egress, like the buffered aggregate, fails Done with `Truncated` while a delivered choice has no finish; it never writes `[DONE]` for it.

### 3.5 Usage snapshots

| `UsageSnapshot` field | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `input_tokens?`, `output_tokens?`, `total_tokens?` | Inclusive input; inclusive output including reasoning; total if reported or derivable. |
| `input_uncached_tokens?`, `cache_read_tokens?`, `cache_write_tokens?` | Non-overlapping input components when the source reports them. |
| `cache_write_by_ttl?` | Map of TTL seconds as decimal strings to counts; Claude keys `300` and `3600`; retain other native buckets in `native`. |
| `reasoning_tokens?`, `input_audio_tokens?`, `output_audio_tokens?` | Subsets, not additions to inclusive totals. |
| `details?` | Other mapped Chat token details, including accepted/rejected prediction and modality breakdowns. |
| `native` | `{protocol, value}` preserving source usage fields and their absence/null distinctions. |
| `derived?` | Field-name array identifying computed rather than reported counts. |
| `final` | Boolean; last authoritative snapshot for this scope when true. |

Omitted counts stay absent; explicit zero stays zero; native null stays in `native`, never coerced to zero. A supplied null clears the corresponding known canonical count; omission alone retains the previous value. Recompute a derived total after operand changes and remove it when an operand is no longer known; never replace an explicit native null with a derived value.
For Claude, inclusive input = uncached input + cache read + cache creation; do not add TTL buckets again to cache creation.
Derive `total_tokens` only from known inclusive `input_tokens` and `output_tokens`; derive Claude inclusive input only when uncached, cache-read and cache-creation counts are all known. Never infer an absent operand as zero. Retain disagreeing provider totals with a content-free diagnostic.
A partial source usage update replaces the fields it supplies in the retained snapshot; it does not add them. Missing fields retain prior known values for that attempt/scope.
Emit the resulting snapshot. A repeated or corrected snapshot replaces the previous one; accounting never sums successive snapshots or their Chat projections.
If a Chat chunk contains native `usage`, publish its canonical snapshot once and treat the chunk field only as an egress projection; account only `x_ck.usage`.
Account each routing attempt independently, including failed attempts when usage is known; bill/record no duplicate client-egress observation. A count_tokens result is never billed as generated output.

### 3.6 Ordering, termination and commitment

A request stream is `request.start`, ordered fields/media, `request.end`, `done`; parse failure uses `error` instead of successful closes.
A response is `response.start`, interleaved choice-local events, exactly one of `done`, `error`, `cancelled`.
For each item: start → block/tool starts → deltas/signatures/results → block/tool ends → item end → choice finish. Independent choices may interleave.
Signatures belong to their original block/part even when emitted after text. All signature fragments precede block end; never merge signatures across blocks.
Whole function calls become start → one arguments delta → end. Streaming calls forward each received argument fragment without waiting for block stop.
An absent whole-call argument field is not invented as `{}`; preserve absence in provenance and represent an empty argument delta only when the source supplies an empty string/object representation.
After a choice finish, only stream-level metadata/usage or other choices may continue. Success needs all opened objects closed and the source completion boundary below.
Source final snapshots are reconciliation inputs, not fresh deltas: do not duplicate text, media or tool arguments already emitted; reject contradictory completions as an upstream error.
Chat ingress drains its own canonical reader before comparing a final `message`, including a `delta` and `message` in the same choice. Ingress and egress share the native position-backed reduction; replay does not observe usage. All supplied choices validate before any snapshot suffix or successful close is published. Text and arguments compare logical decoded prefixes, media compares decoded bytes, and tools match source IDs/indexes rather than array order. Omitted fields retain their prior values.
EOF before that boundary, an unterminated SSE record, missing tool completion or invalid JSON produces `error`, not `done`.
On error/cancellation, open objects are incomplete by definition; do not manufacture successful item/tool/choice ends. No events follow a terminal record. Expiry and eviction (§6.4) end a stream with `error` `stream.gone`; `cancelled` carries only `client_cancel` or `shutdown`.
A successful non-streaming source body supplies the source completion boundary once fully validated; a finite download closes with matching byte counts.
Streaming boundaries: Chat/legacy `[DONE]` after choice finishes; Anthropic `message_stop`; Responses HTTP/WS `response.completed` or valid `response.incomplete`; Interactions `interaction.completed`/`interaction.finish`; Gemini complete HTTP JSON/array framing plus candidate finishes or terminal prompt-block feedback.
Images need each result's completed event and complete HTTP framing; finite speech/video downloads need complete HTTP framing and matching declared lengths. Realtime uses `response.done` per response, Live `turnComplete` per turn, and explicit close per session; packet EOF never ends a session. Count/compact/video-job/search and other buffered results use the validated full-body boundary above. Provider failure markers always produce `error`.
Egress alone decides deliverability. Internal metadata/heartbeat does not commit unless actually converted to client bytes; first emitted role/start/unknown-event bytes do commit.
Suppress transport keepalives and headers that would start a success response before that decision. Once deliverable bytes are scheduled to the client, disable failover even if the socket write fails.

### 3.7 Unknown fields, collisions and destination policy

Preserve unknown JSON members recursively, including array order, scalar type, null versus absence and unrecognized enums; retention is semantic, not original JSON whitespace.
Known Chat fields remain native; other fields live in `X.original` with source pointer/correlation. Do not duplicate known content in a whole-body shadow copy.
Unknown SSE events become `opaque` with source name, payload and SSE fields; valid non-JSON SSE data is a text value. Unsupported internal version is an error, not an unknown event.
A wire field named `x_ck` is untrusted source data: retain it in `original`, never interpret it as gateway control. Only the trusted internal boundary accepts this grammar.
If replay metadata is explicitly accepted by a client codec, validate its version and correlation; it cannot set trusted request IDs, routing attempts, resource limits or authorization.
Unknown fields and events always reach the egress encoder intact. That encoder writes them out where the destination grammar has a place for them (original location, native equivalent or defined extension carrier), and otherwise drops them with a content-free debug log naming field/event, destination and reason.
Known normalized mutations, including deletion, win over stale preserved values; never inject source-specific options into an unrelated provider's request root.
Mapped request semantics are distinct from unknown data: unsupported semantics in the §4 capability list produce 400 at the `request.end` fence before any upstream request is sent; unknown fields alone do not trigger rejection.
B7/B9 response projections occur inside the egress encoder after receipt: select choice 0 for single-choice destinations and drop unsupported grounding/code/URL-context events. Debug logs contain request ID, indexes/event kind and destination, never payload/signatures/tool arguments.

## 4. Internal request

The logical request is a Chat-based document plus `x_ck`, with typed content and structured historical tool input as specified below; it is a view over mmap positions, not a heap `Value` tree or buffered body.

`ck-stream::ByteSpan` borrows a published lease and checks end-exclusive coordinates, generation and record bounds. `EventView` supplies event-name/data spans; `RequestFieldView` supplies pointer/value spans without retaining a second body. Spans can cross frames, clip reads to their own boundaries and reject new reads after invalidation. Empty spans are allowed through the record's exclusive end. Codecs provide parsed locations and remain responsible for SSE/JSON syntax, JSON-pointer meaning, capability checks and the `request.end` fence.

`request.field` uses absolute JSON pointers into this document. Emit parent containers as empty objects/arrays before their child fields; arrays use consecutive numeric indexes.
The reference spelling is `{type: "x_ck_media", media_id: string, value_kind: "bytes"|"utf8"}`. Egress resolves only references registered by trusted ingress at the exact document position in this stream's own media table, never by JSON shape or client-supplied `X.media`; literal look-alike objects pass through as data.
Large strings use registered references with `mime: text/plain;charset=utf-8` and custom-data events; the logical value is concatenated decoded UTF-8. Encoders escape incrementally from positions after validation, not from a second accumulated body.
Chat request ingress rebinds live normalized names, values, media and duplicate-key backing to canonical positions before retiring raw input leases. Pending strings expose only validated prefixes. When later members determine a content part's type, typed publication waits for that context rather than interpreting an unknown subtree as media.
Chat request provenance and mapped cache/replay carriers bind to stable normalized parent objects. Canonical request fields carry binding pointers that the trusted record reader resolves once; later array deletion cannot reassign retained fields to a surviving sibling. The reader also registers every published media payload at its reference once its data offsets are contiguous and its media end reports `completed` with the decoded byte count, so trusted edits reach request egress with their media; a reference is trusted only as the entire value of a request field, and the same shape inside other data stays literal. Request egress writes every data URI payload, retained or registered from a complete string, with the part's current MIME and an empty media type when the MIME was removed. A plain base64 `file_data` payload becomes a data URI when the part has a MIME; audio keeps plain base64 and names its type in `format`. `codec::provenance` owns this protocol-neutral binding format and its pointer helpers. Bound lists are `x_ck.original`, `cache_control`, `replay`, `tools`, `chat_legacy_calls` and `anthropic_order`; carriers are `image_url`, `input_audio`, `file` and the server-result `shape`. Any other carrier rejects reconstruction. Each protocol still interprets its own native `pointer` entries. Wire `x_ck` remains ordinary provenance data. Generic Chat rejects mapped continuation, foreign provider parameters, server tools and signed replay; a distinct destination policy must explicitly accept a registered replay carrier before Chat egress emits it.
Routing may select model/operation/destination early, but no upstream request is sent before the whole internal request, including final fields and media, passes syntax/schema and destination capability validation at `request.end`. Authentication remains outside the document.
Capability validation covers supplied model/operation, roles and ordered content kinds, tool declarations/choice/call-result linkage, signed/encrypted replay, cache directives, sampling/token limits, output schema/modalities, session controls and mapped provider parameters. Unsupported members fail with 400; unknown unmapped fields follow §3.7. No unresolved field is exempt from the fence.

| Logical location | Type/content | Contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model`, `messages[]` | Chat model, ordered roles/content | Preserve system/developer/user/assistant/tool distinctions and original order. |
| `messages[].content` | String, ordered `ContentPart[]` below, or native null | Preserve absent, null and empty content separately; native shape remains in provenance. |
| `messages[].tool_calls`, `tool_call_id`, `name` | History calls `{id, type, function: {name, arguments?: JSON}, arguments_format: "json"\|"text"}` and result linkage | JSON-format arguments are structured JSON; text-format arguments are strings. Trusted client ingress parses Chat argument strings; the upstream Chat egress encoder alone serializes JSON arguments to Chat's string slot. Non-Chat egress writes its native structured value; response deltas still use §3.3 strings. |
| `tools`, `tool_choice`, `parallel_tool_calls` | Chat function tool declarations/options | Native/custom/server tools additionally retain declarations in `X.tools`. |
| `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `max_completion_tokens`, `stop`, `n`, `seed` | Native Chat values | No presence-based field suppression or premature provider normalization. |
| `stream`, `stream_options`, `response_format`, `logprobs`, `top_logprobs` | Client delivery/output controls | Upstream stream selection is separate from client delivery preference. |
| Other native Chat fields | Bias/penalties, modalities/audio, prediction, store, metadata, user/safety identifiers, service tier, etc. | Preserve recursively; explicit fields do not make this an allowlist. |
| `X.v`, `X.original_protocol`, `X.operation` | Version 1; protocol; operation string | `generate`, `count_tokens`, `compact`, media action, realtime action, `alpha_search`. |
| `X.thinking` | `{enabled?, budget_tokens?, effort?, include?, native?: object}` | Keep both semantic controls and source-specific configuration. |
| `X.replay[]` | `{message_index, item_id, block_index, kind, signature?, redacted?, source}` | Bound history signatures/encrypted items, including signature-only parts; never move to another message. |
| `X.cache_control[]` | `{pointer, value}` | Exact breakpoints/TTL directives for messages, parts, system and tools; stable prompt ordering. |
| `X.tools[]` | `{pointer, declaration, namespace?, arguments_format?}` | Native declarations, tool search, custom tools and server-executed tools. |
| `X.provider_parameters` | Protocol-keyed object | Provider-native options without a Chat counterpart; consumed only by boundary codecs. |
| `X.original[]` | `{protocol, pointer, value}` | Every otherwise-unmapped original field; preserve semantic value, not the whole request bytes. |
| `X.session` | `{id?, turn?, previous_response_id?, previous_interaction_id?, environment_id?, mode?}` | Continuation identity; retained history is position-backed and subject to limits. |
| `X.media[]` | `{media_id, pointer, value_kind, mime?, attributes?}` | Projection of trusted per-stream reference registrations; untrusted wire values never populate the table. |
| `X.transport` | `{kind, action?, content_type?, query?, headers?}` | Only content type, multipart names/filenames and non-secret operation query/header values consumed by the codec; no Authorization/Cookie/credential values. |

`X` in this section is the request object's extension, not the per-record envelope; the envelope continues to identify its transport stream. `Q` in the schemas and mapping tables means this logical request, not the questions file.
`ContentPart` and `OperationValue` below are shared schemas in both directions; `?` permits absence, all other fields are mandatory. Strings/JSON may be position-backed; `MediaRef` means a trusted registered reference above. Unknown kinds use `opaque`, never a guessed semantic variant.

| `ContentPart.type` | Fields besides `type` |
| --- | --- |
| `text`, `reasoning`, `reasoning_summary`, `refusal` | `{text: string}`; replay signatures remain in `X.replay`. |
| `image`, `audio`, `video`, `document` | `{source: {kind: "uri", uri: string}\|{kind: "file", file_id: string}\|{kind: "data", ref: MediaRef}, mime?: string, filename?: string, detail?: "auto"\|"low"\|"high", timing?: {start: number, end?: number, unit: "seconds"\|"milliseconds"}, transcript?: string}` |
| `redacted`, `encrypted` | `{data: string, replay_index: uint}`; provider-bound, not readable text. |
| `tool_result` | `{tool_call_id: string, content: ContentPart[], is_error?: bool}` |
| `opaque` | `{protocol: string, value: JSON}`; genuinely unmapped content only. |

| `operation.kind` | `OperationValue` schema |
| --- | --- |
| `video.request` | `{action: "create"\|"edit"\|"extend"\|"retrieve"\|"content", job_id?: string}`; model/text/options/media in Q; ID mandatory except create. |
| `video.job` | `{job_id: string, status: "queued"\|"running"\|"completed"\|"failed"\|"cancelled"\|"expired", progress?: number, created_at?: number, completed_at?: number, error?: {code: string, message: string}}`; progress fraction 0–1, timestamps Unix seconds. |
| `alpha_search` | `{phase: "request", query: string, limit?: uint}\|{phase: "result", results: [{title?: string, uri?: string, text?: string}]}`; native extra fields use `X.original`. |
| `realtime.control` | `{action: "offer"\|"answer", sdp: MediaRef}\|{action: "session.configure"\|"session.created"\|"session.updated", config: RealtimeConfig}\|{action: "response.create"\|"response.append", request_id: string}\|{action: "response.cancel", response_id?: string}\|{action: "audio.commit"\|"audio.clear", track_id: string}\|{action: "session.close", reason?: string}` |
| `realtime.rates` | `{limits: [{name: string, remaining: number, limit?: number, reset_after_ms?: uint}]}` |

`RealtimeConfig = {model?: string, modalities?: ("text"|"audio"|"image"|"video")[], voice?: string, instructions?: string, tools?: Q.tools, tool_choice?: Q.tool_choice, input_audio?: AudioFormat, output_audio?: AudioFormat, turn_detection?: {mode: "disabled"|"server_vad"|"semantic_vad", threshold?: number, prefix_ms?: uint, silence_ms?: uint}}`; `AudioFormat = {codec: string, sample_rate_hz?: uint, channels?: uint}`. Omission preserves existing session settings; provider-only extras use `X.provider_parameters`.
Conversation items/tool results use Q history; audio append uses media events, whose packet attributes are `{track_id: string, packet_id: string, timestamp: uint, timebase_hz: uint, sequence?: uint, payload_type?: uint, flags?: string[]}`. Response controls reference a separately validated request; cancellation is not successful completion. Unknown sideband commands use `opaque`; mapped commands never do.
An ingress codec parses and stores preserved fields once; egress overlays normalized values. Removing a field removes its stale source projection too.
Signature replay is opaque and provider-bound; never fabricate a signature, substitute a validator-bypass token or silently discard an unsupported signed history block.
Wire capture, when enabled, occurs only at ingress/egress through the sanctioned redacting logging boundary, not by serializing internal events into logs (`crates/AGENTS.md`, Logging and Security).

## 5. Field mappings

Tables below are normative: request tables cover client decode **and** upstream encode; response tables cover upstream decode **and** client encode, including buffered variants.
`Q` below means the logical request (not the questions file); `X` means its extension or an event envelope; `C` means a Chat chunk; `E(name)` means the registered named event.
Every unlisted field uses §3.7; no table is a discard allowlist. Reverse mappings restore native fields when present, synthesize only absent identities and obey destination capability policy.
For request destinations unable to express a supplied semantic field in §4's capability list, return 400 at its validation fence; responses apply §3.7 and B7/B9 rather than inventing data.

### 5.1 Anthropic Messages — request, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model`, `stream`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `stop_sequences` | Q native options; `stop`; `X.provider_parameters.anthropic.top_k` | Preserve independent values; upstream encoder applies provider validation. |
| `system`, `messages[].role`, `content[].text` | Q messages and ordered text parts | String versus block-list shape retained in original metadata. |
| `thinking`, `output_config`, thinking block `thinking/signature`, `redacted_thinking.data` | `X.thinking`, `X.replay` | Preserve block association, effort/budget and opaque replay bytes. |
| `image/document.source`, URL/base64/file data, citation controls | Q content + `X.media`; `X.original` | MIME and document metadata survive; media uses data events. |
| `tool_use.{id,name,input}`, `tool_result.{tool_use_id,content,is_error}` | Q calls/results + `X.tools` | Structured JSON input becomes an argument string only at Chat encoding. |
| `tools`, `tool_choice`, `disable_parallel_tool_use`, server tools | Q tools/options + `X.tools` | Preserve server tool type, namespace and native schemas. |
| `cache_control`, `metadata`, `service_tier`, remaining fields | `X.cache_control`, Q metadata/tier, `X.original` | Keep TTL and cache boundaries on the exact source object. |

| `text_delta.text`, `thinking_delta.thinking`, full text/thinking blocks | C content/reasoning + block kind | Full bodies decompose into the same events. |
| `signature_delta.signature`, thinking signature, redacted data | `reasoning.signature`, `reasoning.redacted` | Signature fragments end before their thinking block closes. |
| `tool_use`, `input_json_delta.partial_json`, `server_tool_use`, results | `tool.start`, C argument deltas, `tool.end`, `tool.result` | Forward arguments incrementally; preserve server-tool distinction. |

| `message_delta.stop_reason/stop_sequence`, `message_stop`, `error`, `ping` | C finish + X native fields; `done`, `error`, `heartbeat` | Preserve stop sequence; message stop is not another finish delta. |

### 5.3 OpenAI Chat — request, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `model`, messages/roles/content, native sampling/limits/delivery fields | Same Q fields | All native fields retained, including nullable values. |
| Tools, legacy `functions/function_call`, tool history, tool choice | Q tools/calls + original spelling | Normalize call lifecycle without losing legacy declaration shape. |
| `reasoning_effort`, `reasoning`, signature extensions | `X.thinking`, bound `X.replay` | Native reasoning text remains a content property, not a signature. |
| `image_url`, `input_audio`, files, audio options/modalities | Q typed parts + `X.media`, Q audio/modalities | Decode embedded bytes incrementally; retain URLs as references. |
| Cache/provider/unknown extensions | `X.cache_control`, `X.provider_parameters`, `X.original` | Reserved-prefix collisions follow §3.7. |

### 5.4 OpenAI Chat — response, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id/object/created/model/system_fingerprint/service_tier` | C base; source metadata | Buffered `chat.completion` decomposes into chunk events. |
| `choices[].index`, `delta` or `message`, role/content/refusal/reasoning | Same C fields + item/block lifecycle | Separate choice state; preserve empty strings versus absent fields. The first of `reasoning_content`, `reasoning` and `reasoning_details` that yields text (a string, a string `text` member, or those forms nested in arrays) becomes `reasoning_content`; that alias is consumed and unselected aliases stay unknown data. |
| Tool index/id/type/function name/arguments, custom-tool content | `tool.start`, C arguments, `tool.end` | A validated finish supplies tool end if Chat has no separate marker. |
| `choices[].logprobs`, content/refusal token arrays/top alternatives/bytes | C `choices[].logprobs` | No empty replacement arrays or dropped logprobs-only chunks. |
| Audio id/data/transcript/expiry; images/annotations | Media events, `annotation`, X original | Preserve source identity and timing; do not store media twice. |

| Input item id/type/status, function/custom calls, call_id, outputs | Q calls/results + `X.tools`, `X.original` | Item ID differs from call ID; custom tool text is not forced into JSON. |
| Reasoning summary/encrypted_content, `reasoning.effort/summary` | `X.replay`, `X.thinking` | Keep encrypted items intact, never synthesize empty encryption. |
| `tools`, tool_choice, parallel_tool_calls, built-in tools/tool search | Q tools + `X.tools` | Preserve namespace, format, schema and native tool configuration. |
| `max_output_tokens`, `text.format`, temperature/top_p, truncation/include | Q token limit/response_format; `X.provider_parameters.responses` | Keep native token-limit spelling in original metadata. |
| `previous_response_id`, conversation, store/background, metadata, service tier | `X.session`, Q store/metadata/tier, provider parameters | Continuation and persistence options are not silently discarded. |

### 5.6 OpenAI Responses HTTP — response, both directions

| content_part and text/refusal delta/done; content_index/logprobs/annotations | Block lifecycle, C content/refusal/logprobs, `annotation` | Full done snapshots reconcile, not duplicate deltas. |
| Reasoning text/summary parts/index; encrypted_content | C reasoning + block kind, `reasoning.signature` | Summary/full reasoning and encryption stay distinct. |
| Function/custom arguments/input delta/done; call_id/name/namespace | Tool lifecycle + C arguments | Preserve item-call relation and text-vs-JSON format. |
| Image generation partial/result; audio/transcript; tool execution metadata | Media events, `tool.result`, `operation` | Preserve output identity and partial-result boundaries. |
| usage; completed/incomplete/failed; incomplete_details/error | `usage`, finish/native reason, `done` or `error` | A valid incomplete result may end successfully with a length/filter finish; failure is terminal error. |

### 5.7 OpenAI Responses WebSocket — request, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `type: response.create/response.append`, turn/request IDs | `X.transport.action`, `X.session` | Each turn gets a request ID; connection lifetime is separate. |
| `input`, model/instructions, previous_response_id, tools and all HTTP fields | §5.5 Q mappings | Resolve explicit continuation using position-backed session history; retain what was supplied versus inherited. |
| Cancel/close and other control messages | `operation` or `cancelled` | Known controls act at the boundary; unknown commands reach capability validation. |

### 5.8 OpenAI Responses WebSocket — response, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Response JSON events/type/sequence/item/usage | §5.6 events | Egress strips internal SSE framing, emits destination JSON messages. |
| Event IDs, connection/turn correlation, error/status | X source/session correlation; `error` | No new upstream attempt after a deliverable WS event. |

| `functionCall.{id,name,args}`, `functionResponse` | Q calls/results, `X.tools` | Preserve provided IDs; whole call becomes one delta in response form. |
| generationConfig sampling/limits/candidateCount/response schema/modalities | Q native options and response_format; provider parameters | Include audio, not only text/image. |
| thinkingConfig, cachedContent, tools/toolConfig, safetySettings, labels | `X.thinking`, cache/provider parameters, Q tools | No invented cache entry or safety policy. |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Responses model/input/instructions/previous state and options | §5.5 Q; `X.operation: compact` | Same preserved item/signature history as generation. |
| stream flag | Q delivery control | Client compact remains non-streaming; stream=true is rejected. |

### 5.18 compact — response, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id/object/created_at/model/output[] including compaction/encrypted items | Response start + ordered `compact` events | Preserve opaque items and item IDs, not a text summary substitute. |
| usage, metadata, status/error | Usage, X original, terminal | Aggregate the compact response only at egress. |

### 5.19 Images — request, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| model/prompt/n/size/quality/style/background/output format/compression/moderation | Q model/text/n; `X.provider_parameters.images` | Preserve native controls and requested result format. |
| image/images/mask/reference images; multipart field names/filenames/content types | X media references + data events | Multipart decoding is incremental; preserve part order, not boundary bytes. |
| stream/partial_images/response_format/user and unknown fields | Q delivery; provider parameters/original | A single finished result still uses the same internal stream. |

### 5.20 Images — response, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| created/data[]/url/b64_json/mime_type/output_format | Response/item/media lifecycle; data or URI reference | Preserve image index and actual MIME; no MIME inferred from field name alone. |
| revised_prompt, dimensions/quality/background, partial/completed event fields | Media attributes/X original/operation | Retain created time and revised prompt in emulated and native streams. |
| usage/errors | Usage/terminal | Duplicate per-image source usage snapshots are not additive. |

### 5.21 Audio/speech — request, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| model, input/text, voice/voice_id, language, speed, instructions | Q model/text; `X.provider_parameters.audio` | Preserve instructions and original voice independently of provider voice mapping. |
| response_format/output_format codec/sample_rate, stream options | Q delivery; X media attributes/provider parameters | Audio input files use the same multipart/media mapping when an operation supports them. |

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Raw audio body/content type, JSON audio/base64, codec/rate/channels | Media lifecycle + data events | Egress writes raw audio incrementally; non-JSON bytes do not undergo UTF-8 validation. |
| Transcript, timestamps, segment/word timing, audio IDs/expiry | Transcript/media attributes/X original | Keep units and audio-text association. |
| Usage/error/EOF | Usage/terminal | HTTP success plus complete body supplies media end; truncated body is error. |

### 5.23 Video — request, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |

### 5.25 Realtime/Live — request, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SDP offer, session config/model/modalities/voice/tools, call/session IDs | X session; `operation(kind: realtime.control)` | §4 offer/config schema; SDP is registered UTF-8 media with MIME, credentials stay outside. |

### 5.26 Realtime/Live — response, both directions

| Wire fields | Internal location | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SDP answer, session created/updated, call/response/item IDs | §4 answer/session controls; X source/session | Transport negotiation remains outside internal stages. |
| Text/audio/transcript/tool events, audio deltas, media packets | C deltas/tool lifecycle/media events | Both directions use the same chunk ceiling and collection timer. |
| Usage/rate limits, errors, response.done/session close | Usage/`realtime.rates`/terminal per response or session | §4 rates schema; response.done does not close a live connection. |

All accepted realtime media MUST traverse codecs; WebRTC ingress/egress terminate media transport and re-encode packet data through the internal stream rather than negotiate a direct bypass.
WebRTC media conversion applies only when the existing `media-relay` build feature is built (`crates/ck-server/src/realtime/api/relay.rs:1-7`); this spec adds no dependency. Builds without it reject WebRTC media visibly; feature-enabled builds must use the relay, never accept a direct media bypass.
Alpha-search requests/results use the §4 `alpha_search` schema and X original; AI Studio inference uses the Gemini codec with relay correlation. These are not exemptions.
Current alpha search bypasses translation (`crates/ck-server/src/inference/codex_alpha.rs:4-6`); the browser relay registers an executor-side session (`crates/ck-server/src/realtime/aistudio_relay.rs:4-11`).

Current compact rejects stream=true (`crates/ck-server/src/inference/openai.rs:1064-1079`); S0 retains that operation contract, not a raw-body shortcut.

## 6. Storage

### 6.1 Pool, frames and ownership

Owner ruling (G3, 2026-11-14): each process keeps one preallocated mmap pool file that holds all stream bytes in 50,000-byte frames (§2). Fixed frames and position-based access are interoperability requirements. Frame `i` starts at `header + i × 50,000`; only the mapping is page-aligned, so frames need not be.
The measured design, from the S0 storage benchmark (§9.3):

- **Header, committed length and growth.** Allocator metadata tracks the pool's backed frame count, distinct from each stream's committed end. Each stream owns a 128-byte-aligned mapped header slot indexed by stream handle; the slot records only its committed end. This applies the owner's G3 answer (readers learn committed length from the header) per stream because one pool holds many streams. The writer stores the committed end with Release ordering after writing bytes and table entries; readers load it with Acquire, and each publication wakes readers (§6.2). Stream identity, invalidation and retained sequence bounds reject stale access; no mapped publication-generation or backed-size field is needed. The slot count and layout are an **S1 choice**. The pool is preallocated to an initial size and grows by `fallocate` when no free frame is left and §6.4 allows. Check `fallocate` and return its error (G7). Never grow with `ftruncate` alone: sparse-page faults can raise SIGBUS on tmpfs exhaustion instead of returning ENOSPC (measured on a 64 MiB tmpfs). The mapping covers the whole limit once, so growth never moves it. The S0 benchmark measured growth stalls only on per-request files (1 MiB extents stalled at most 0.33 ms); the pool's growth stall is unmeasured.
- **Free lists.** Each thread has its own LIFO list of free frames, with the locks at least 128 bytes apart so two lists never share a cache line. A thread takes frames from its own list first, then steals resident frames from another thread's list, and only then takes a cold frame (§6.5). Each list mirrors its length in an atomic, so allocation passes over lists that look empty without locking them; before growing the file it rescans every list under its lock, so a stale length never causes growth. Allocation prefaults the pages under the reservation's bytes with one `MADV_POPULATE_WRITE`, outside every pool lock, and a record that continues a frame prefaults the further pages it reaches before writing, so a full tmpfs returns an error instead of raising SIGBUS. A continuing prefault asks for at least twice the populated prefix, so a frame written in small records fills in about five calls; when tmpfs refuses that, it retries with only the pages the record needs. The pool records each frame's populated prefix; a punch resets it. Do not use one shared FIFO list: it measured -94% req/s against heap on 2 KiB requests at 64 tasks (644,185 against 10,719,382 req/s), because every request contends on one lock and touches a cold frame.
- **Shared counters.** Every object that each request updates (the pool budget, the stream-table owner and their reference counts) is aligned to 128 bytes. Without it, false sharing doubled cycles per request at 64 tasks (27-33k against 12-13k) with the same instruction count.
- **Why a pool.** One mmap file per request cost -94% req/s on 2 KiB requests sequentially and -99% at 64 tasks, because `mmap`, `MADV_POPULATE_WRITE` and `munmap` serialise on the process's mmap lock and `munmap` sends TLB-shootdown IPIs to every CPU running the process. The pool needs no `mmap` or `munmap` on the request path and matches or beats heap in every measured row except one that is still open (§9.3).
- **Reader pinning.** A frame in use by a reader is never reused or reclaimed. A frame joins a free list only after its last lease and retention reference release it, and the reclaimer touches only frames already on a free list.

A `Position` is `(frame_number, offset)` scoped by a stream handle/generation; `offset` is in `[0, 50000)`. Frame numbers do not wrap/reuse within a stream. Each stream has a frame table of integer pool-frame indexes, like a page table, plus generation/ownership and committed extents. This is per-block state, not retained raw pointers; resolve temporary borrowed slices only under a read lease.
Request/response directions of one exchange share its stream quota; reclaiming another exchange cannot raise this quota. Duplex sessions retain separate turn quotas, with shared session replay charged to the pool/cache and its retaining exchange until released.
Stages hold only start/current/end positions for byte access; retention positions are such positions. Identity indexes and bounded scalar counters are metadata; identity strings and variable metadata remain position-backed.
No `Vec<Bytes>`, body-sized String, JSON tree, tool-argument accumulator or media queue may store stream content on the heap.
Network/TLS library scratch is not a second stream store: consume it immediately into mapped storage, bound it by transport settings and include it in measurements.
Codecs scan borrowed mapped spans and write encoding output into mapped frames; string escaping/base64 and cross-block tokens are incremental, never assembled into a heap event.
Request records, normalized events, boundary framing scratch, unknown payloads, replacement records and aggregation output all charge their actual live mapped frames to stream and pool limits.
General records may span frames; readers parse across positions. A text SSE event larger than a frame occupies consecutive frames, addressed as (frame, offset). Custom-data records start at a fresh frame boundary and fit one frame; unused tail space is padding, not stream bytes.
A separate event index stores only start/end positions and type/correlation indexes; retained index metadata has a configured ceiling too.

### 6.2 Writer/reader publication
**S1 choice:** a stream metadata lock implements the publication/lease protocol below; one synchronization mechanism makes complete-prefix visibility and safe reuse explicit. Each lease holds a reference on every frame it pins, counted per frame next to the stream's own reference, so releasing a single-frame lease and refreshing the last-read time on acknowledgement take no lock; the last reference returns the frame to a free list. The refresh only raises the time, so an acknowledgement that sampled the clock before a newer read finished cannot make its stream look older. Last-read times are kept in whole milliseconds and a refresh within the stored millisecond skips the atomic update; streams read within the same millisecond are unordered, which a one-hour cache expiry tolerates. A lease spanning several frames keeps their list on the heap; the list is charged to `max_metadata_bytes` from pinning until the lease drops, so leases kept after their readers drop cannot grow uncharged metadata. Those invariants, not the lock mechanism, are interoperability requirements.

| Actor/step | Required operation |
| --- | --- |
| Writer admission | One writer per stream; reserve every needed frame/table entry under allocator ownership before writing it. |
| Append | Write only unpublished mapped bytes; published event bytes are immutable. Finish JSON and SSE delimiter before publishing the event. |
| Publish | Under the stream metadata lock, install frame-table extents/event boundaries and advance the stream's committed end position (header slot, Release store). |
| Wake | Notify readers after unlocking. Publication uses the lock's release/acquire ordering; mmap visibility alone is not synchronization. |
| Read | Register a read lease under the same lock and set the stream's last-read time from a monotonic clock; copy only table/cursor metadata, then read immutable bytes no later than the committed end. |
| Wait | Register notification before rechecking committed end, sequence bounds, invalidation and terminal state under the lock; refresh last-read time on each pending wait, then sleep only if unchanged. |
| Acknowledge | Advance the consumer cursor, refresh the stream's last-read time and release the lease. Request-direction and scratch ranges also advance their aggregation positions and return to the releasing thread's free list when no lease or retention reference remains (§6.1). A response stream's frames stay in the cache queue (§6.4) and become free only after expiry or eviction and the last lease release. |
| Transform | A stage that rewrites an event writes replacement records into fresh mapped spans; publish downstream sequence/correlation atomically, never mutate bytes another reader sees. |
| Fail/cancel | Upstream error, explicit client cancel or shutdown: set the terminal error/cancellation state, publish the terminal record after the published prefix when space permits and wake all readers. The prefix stays readable, so a resuming reader (§6.6) receives it and then the terminal event. A client disconnect is neither. |
| Producer loss | A writer dropped without a terminal (its producer task aborted or panicked): set the terminal state to `error` `stream.producer_lost` (status 502, scope `upstream`), publish it after the published prefix when space permits and wake all readers. It is not a client cancel; the prefix stays readable for resume. |
| Invalidate | Expiry or eviction (§6.4): atomically invalidate the stream's data, set the terminal state to `error` `stream.gone` (status 410, scope `resource`) and wake all readers; publish that record when space permits. Every attached reader, including one holding a lease, receives that one `error` event then end-of-stream, not the invalidated backlog. If upstream is still being collected, cancel it now. Successful `done` instead follows the complete published prefix. |
| Recycle | Reuse a frame only after all reader leases and retained references release it; stream-scoped position identity, invalidation and retained sequence bounds reject stale access. |

Committed end covers complete records only; it is the stream's header-slot position (§6.1), loaded with Acquire. A reader may observe the old complete prefix or the new complete prefix, never half JSON, stale reused content or an uninitialized frame-table entry.
The allocator's backed frame count (§6.1) bounds where frames may exist; it is not a stream's committed end. There is no polling of file size and no per-event msync/fsync durability promise.
Terminal control state stores a bounded error code, not a heap data fallback; readers synthesize the error event from it when no frame remains. Egress emits a bounded destination error or aborts transport if that is impossible; never report successful completion.

### 6.3 Lifecycle, directory and permissions

Create the private directory before the pool, mode 0700, owned by the process user; reject an unsafe/symlinked location rather than using a public temporary directory.
Default directory is `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cooker/` (G2); deployment must provide it on tmpfs or explicitly configure another private directory. Missing XDG_RUNTIME_DIR requires explicit configuration, not a silent fallback.
Unlink the pool file immediately where possible (G4): use O_TMPFILE with mode 0600, or create exclusively with mode 0600 and unlink before accepting stream data. Where neither works, keep the path until the pool closes at shutdown, then delete it. There is no startup sweep (G5).
The pool descriptor/mapping lives for the process; a stream's table and frames are removed by expiry or eviction (§6.4) once the last consumer releases them, not the shared pool inode.
On disconnect, release only that reader's lease and connection state; the stream is neither cancelled nor released (§6.6). A reader that never releases retains its frames (§6.4). Shutdown stops work before unmapping; process death closes the unlinked inode after its last reference, with no startup sweep.
The application adds no encryption (G6); protection comes from OS disk and memory encryption, the 0600 file and the 0700 directory. tmpfs is not free memory and may swap; disk-backed mappings may persist physical remnants after unlink. Permissions/unlink are not secure erasure.
Never expose the pool FD, filesystem path or other streams' frames to a client. Do not mix transient stream storage with the durable configuration database.

**S1 choice: runtime ownership.** The runtime owns the pool, cache, producer task tracker, expiry work and one-second reclaimer. Each attempt owns its upstream collector, codec work, scheduler completion and usage settlement. HTTP bodies, WS connections and WebRTC peers own reader leases, not producers. Dropping a connection releases its reader only; upgraded sessions do not detach from runtime tracking.

Shutdown follows `docs/STATE-AND-CONCURRENCY.md`, Explicit execution and lifetime:

1. Stop new inference, turn, resume and relay admission through the listener/runtime owner.
2. Signal active producers with `cancelled(reason: shutdown)` and cancel upstream I/O and cooperative codec work. Wake readers through terminal control state even when no frame is available. Keep completed prefixes readable until readers close.
3. Close downstream HTTP, WS and media transports. Join producers and admitted codec/blocking work; settle each attempt's scheduler and usage outcome once. Resume never owns a second settlement.
4. Stop and join expiry and reclaim work. Release cache retention and wait for every reader lease and mapped borrow to end. Never force reuse or unmap beneath a lease.
5. Close the pool mapping/descriptor and remove only its fallback pathname, if present. Keep durable configuration shutdown under its existing owner.

Cancellation notification is not a join. A stuck lease prevents safe pool teardown; it does not authorize early unmapping. Stream bytes are not restart recovery inputs. A restart loses resume state and old IDs return 410.

### 6.4 Limits and the cache queue

Two structures hold frames. The free lists (§6.1) hold unused frames for allocation. The cache queue below holds every stream's retained frames in order of last read and decides which stream is invalidated after expiry or under size pressure. A frame moves from the queue to a free list only after its last lease and retention reference release it.
Owner ruling (G8, Settled 41, 2026-11-14): 「我记得这个 sse 缓存队列是1h加最大256MB总容量最大4G设计的，我们直接存进去就可以，不需要单独算别的缓存了，使用最近读取就不清理，最老没有读取就清理的方式滚动刷新缓存（和1h清理超时缓存）」. Applied:

- **One queue.** Every stream byte goes into the cache queue. There is no separate unread buffer, retained-backlog or replay accounting. Delivery does not release a response stream's bytes: the gateway cannot know how far a client got, and a reconnecting client resumes from any position it did not receive (§6.6). Request-direction and scratch ranges, which no client resumes, are released as in §7 and count against the same limits while they live.
- **Limits.** At most 256 MiB per stream and at most 4 GiB in total. The owner wrote MB and GB; this spec states every capacity in MiB and GiB (§3.4 defines KiB), so 256 MiB is 268,435,456 bytes, ⌊268,435,456 / 50,000⌋ = 5,368 frames (268,400,000 bytes), and 4 GiB is 85,899 frames. An owner may correct the unit to decimal. The 4 GiB is the owner's maximum; the startup caps in `stream.pool_bytes` only lower it.
- **Least recent read.** The entry is a stream's retained range and is evicted whole. Reader attachment, every pending wait, lease registration and delivered acknowledgment refresh last-read time. A stream never read counts from creation. Size pressure evicts the stream with the oldest last read, including attached streams; leases still prevent physical reuse.
- **1 h expiry.** A stream with no attached reader expires when its last read is older than 1 h. An attached reader waiting for data counts as reading throughout the wait, including a quiet Realtime/WS session: maintenance refreshes its timestamp instead of expiring it. Detaching refreshes the timestamp through the end of that attached interval; disconnect does not remove the stream. This implements the maintainer decision of 2026-11-14 recorded in OWNER-RULINGS.

| Configuration knob | Default and unit/scope | Accounting/rationale |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `stream.pool_directory` | `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/cooker/`, directory/process | Private tmpfs location (§6.3); no fallback when XDG is absent. |
| `stream.pool_bytes` | min(4 GiB, 50% of the tmpfs size from `statvfs` at start, cgroup `memory.max` less heap headroom), rounded down to a frame multiple; log the derived value | Bounds mapped storage and holds the whole cache queue. 4 GiB is the owner's maximum; the tmpfs and cgroup terms are startup caps below it. Tmpfs is usually 10% of RAM under logind, so the tmpfs term is often the effective limit; a service may have no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`. Ignore the cgroup term when `memory.max` is `max`. The heap headroom size is an S1 choice. |
| `stream.startup_reserve_bytes` | 0 bytes/process until a measured candidate passes all three cold rows; explicit values round up to 50,000-byte frames, within the resolved pool capacity | `ck-stream::Config::startup_reserve_bytes` accepts an explicit override; zero disables the persistent reserve, not the initial demand-growth extent. Reject an explicit value above the resolved frame capacity. The fixed physical prefix is backed with `fallocate` and populated before pool open returns; decay never punches it. Headers and final page rounding are additional overhead. |
| `stream.max_frames` | min(5,368, `pool_frames`) frames, where 5,368 = ⌊256 MiB / 50,000⌋ and `pool_frames` = `pool_bytes` / 50,000 (85,899 at the 4 GiB ceiling) | Request/response/scratch/replay of one exchange combined; a ceiling, not a reservation. At the 4 GiB ceiling at most 16 full-size streams fit (16 × 5,368 = 85,888 frames). |
| `stream.max_event_bytes` | 1 MiB/event | Ordinary framed event including extensions; bound parser work, chunk large content/media instead. |
| `stream.max_metadata_bytes` | 1 MiB/exchange | Tables/indexes/parser/consumer bookkeeping; bound tiny-event amplification. |
| `stream.cache_ttl` | 1 h since the stream's last read | Owner number (Settled 41). |

**S1 choice: deploy-only settings.** All seven knobs in this table are read and validated at startup. Changing any of them requires a restart. Configuration/schema declarations must classify them as deploy-only, not hot-applied runtime settings. Configured overrides remain supported within §6.4 validation and owner ceilings. There is no live-editable admin page or page exception for these values. Any later hot-change support must add its admin page in the same change. `REQUIREMENTS.md`, Deploy-only stream settings, records this classification.

The unset knobs (event and metadata sizes, initial pool size, growth step, headroom) use provisional S1 defaults, **unmeasured, replace after the §9 benchmarks**. The server starts if directory/mapping and the validation below succeed; configured overrides remain supported.

Phase B's `ck-stream::Store` owns retention and a joined maintenance thread. `Writer::begin_record` reserves the complete record; `Reservation::write` fills unpublished spans and `commit` publishes only after the declared length is written. Codecs remain responsible for valid JSON/SSE framing. `Reader` delivers complete-record `Lease` values and one scalar terminal outcome, then EOF. A lease resolves borrowed chunks by generation-scoped `Position`; invalidation rejects new chunk access while already borrowed bytes remain pinned. `Writer::release_before` is only for non-resumable canonical request prefixes, never response retention or independent scratch leases. Internal numeric stream generations are not authorization tokens.

`Writer::cancelled()` returns an owned, cancellation-safe future yielding the scalar terminal outcome. It wakes on expiry, eviction, explicit cancellation, storage failure and shutdown, as well as normal completion, and resolves immediately if already terminal. Producers can select it against upstream I/O without borrowing the writer; a data publication alone does not wake it. The runtime must still cancel upstream work and join its producer tasks (§6.3).

Owner-approved extension (2026-11-14, Settled 45): `Writer::begin_scratch(len)` reserves unpublished source bytes from the same pool and the owning stream's same `max_frames`, including canonical frames still pinned after prefix release. `ScratchReservation::write` fills the reservation; `complete` requires its exact declared length and returns an immutable `ScratchLease` without copying payload. Scratch never enters the canonical frame table or event index, advances committed end or sequence, or appears to readers. `ScratchLease::chunk(offset)` uses lease-local byte offsets and returns at most the remainder of one frame; offsets at or beyond `len()` are invalid. Zero-length reservations are invalid; `max_event_bytes` limits canonical records, while scratch is bounded by shared frame and metadata quotas.

Scratch reservations and completed leases own their frames without borrowing `Writer`, so source retention and canonical publication can interleave. Drop releases scratch independently through normal free lists, without punching or `release_before`. Invalidation rejects new writes, completion and reads with `Gone`; existing borrows pin the frames until their lease drops. Completed scratch remains readable after writer or store drop unless invalidated. Partial allocation failures roll back all acquired frames and their quota reservations. Pool allocation that can evict runs without the stream metadata lock.

`Writer::reserve_metadata(bytes)` returns an owned `MetadataPermit` against the same `max_metadata_bytes` used by canonical tables, indexes and readers. Codecs charge allocated vector capacity, not its current length, before growing it and retain the permit until that capacity is freed. `MetadataPermit::resize` preserves the previous charge on failed growth; shrinking and drop release it even after termination or invalidation. Growth requires a live, nonterminal stream. Scratch frame-table capacity and handle bookkeeping also consume this quota. Every frame/metadata quota or pool failure uses the existing `Terminal::StorageExhausted` path, including reader admission; no new quota, scratch-owner stream or heap payload fallback is introduced.

Current storage choices are a startup reserve plus at least min(21, pool capacity) initial frames, 21-frame growth extents, 4,096 mapped header slots, 64 MiB cgroup heap headroom and the existing 1 MiB event/metadata defaults. The reserve follows the owner's 2026-11-14 morning option B: measure 64 MiB (1,343 frames) before 256 MiB (5,369 frames), including startup, idle decay and post-decay bursts. Physical reserve frames count within the pool cap, not against any one stream's quota. Metadata accounting includes allocated canonical and scratch frame/index capacity, scratch handle bookkeeping, reader entries, multi-frame lease frame lists and external permits. A `ManualClock` makes expiry deterministic; physical decay still belongs to the one-second runtime tick.

S1B4 measured 64 and 256 MiB with seven alternating pool/heap pairs on CCD0. Neither passes all three cold rows: 64 MiB fails all three; 256 MiB passes small-64 but fails concurrent-256 and concurrent-1024 TTFB p99. No passing reserve was adopted as the default; zero preserves the previous demand-backed default rather than selecting a failed candidate. Explicit reserves remain available for deployment measurement. The maintainer's 2026-11-14 interpretation of option B charges the configured resident budget separately under §9.3; raw memory measurements still include it. Raw samples, resource costs and post-decay bursts are retained under `/home/zakk/code/jev-router/p4/s1b-gate/s1b4-reserve{64,256}{,-decay}/`.

Retained event indexes coalesce consecutive records only when length, stride, type, correlation and the next start coordinate match. Each run preserves individual sequence numbers and exact record boundaries; lookup uses binary search, and partial canonical prefix release can trim a run. Variable records remain separately indexed and bounded. Index/table growth is geometric within the unchanged metadata ceiling; leases reconstruct public `Record` views without copying payload bytes.

Reservation input errors (`len == 0`, above `max_event_bytes`, or an aligned record larger than one frame) return `InvalidRecord` without changing the published prefix or terminating the writer. Frame/metadata exhaustion and failed backing reservations remain terminal storage failures; operator-facing I/O errors preserve their OS cause.

Per-stream metadata and the cache index use `parking_lot::Mutex`; publication, invalidation and lease pin updates retain the same exclusive critical sections. These mutexes do not poison after an unwinding panic. The retention-fence lock keeps its existing poisoning behavior.

Reads update timestamps under each stream's metadata lock. Eviction and expiry set a maintenance flag before taking stream locks; readers, and the writer transitions that return counted frames (rollback, prefix release and invalidation through `finish`), observing the flag drop their stream lock and wait on the retention fence, so a victim's counted gain cannot shrink before eviction invalidates it. Once maintenance has observed a stream, the metadata lock's release/acquire edge makes later readers observe that flag. An eviction walks the queue least recently read first, at 1 ms resolution, excluding the allocating stream, and requeues each stale head once at its real last-read timestamp; the fence keeps an observed timestamp stable, so one requeue is exact. It counts only what a victim would return now (owned, unleased frames, or a header slot) and skips victims that would return nothing. It invalidates the chosen victims only when their total covers the request; otherwise it invalidates nothing and the allocation fails with `stream.storage_exhausted`. Header-slot exhaustion and ENOSPC from pool growth or a cold-frame prefault run the same eviction once before failing. Cache membership remains separately locked.

The retention fence and clock have shared ownership independent of cache membership. Each stream retains that context; readers and leases retain only their stream, so ordinary record delivery does not increment a process-wide cache reference count. Leases still keep the mapping and retention context alive after store shutdown.

Complete `append` calls hold the metadata guard while checking reservation bounds, but release it before each pool allocation that may evict. After allocation they reacquire the guard and revalidate invalidation and terminal state; failure releases the new frame and rolls back newly reserved frames. Writing and publication then share that reacquired guard. Incremental reservations retain no guard between calls. Leases cache their first pinned physical frame, check atomic invalidation before each new borrow, and combine acknowledgment with pin release under one guard.

Payload writes reuse the reserved start frame and offset, then advance through logical frame-table entries. They do not assume adjacent physical frames; each span retains checked table lookup and pool bounds before copying.

Readers cache the committed end acquired from the mapped header and its complete-record count under the metadata lock. Records within that acquired prefix need no repeated header load or notification registration; invalidation and leases still use the lock for every read. A pending reader registers before rechecking, so publication cannot be lost between the first check and sleep. After waking, readers check for a ready record before registering another waiter; a still-pending read returns to the register-then-recheck path.

Owner ruling (D2, 2026-11-14): a slow consumer never pauses upstream reads. The stream keeps collecting into the cache queue and the gateway relays at the client's pace. Only `max_frames` and the pool bound that backlog, and it expires and is evicted like every other entry.
Startup rejects zero capacities or ttl, a `pool_bytes` that is not a frame multiple, `max_frames < 4`, `max_frames > pool_frames`, or `max_event_bytes > max_frames * 50000`. Metadata must hold the configured frame table plus one event index and reader entry; validate against actual entry sizes with checked arithmetic.
1. Keep every stream's retained frames in last-read order; a read moves the stream to the recent end. Bytes arriving for a stream nobody reads do not refresh it. Physical reuse always waits for the last lease. Upstream reads never pause for a slow consumer (D2); every arriving byte and timer flush consumes quota.
2. Expiry: when a stream has no attached reader and its last read is older than `cache_ttl`, invalidate it (§6.2). Attached readers count as reading throughout a wait; the periodic check refreshes them even without another poll or publication. Upstream collection runs to its terminal event until invalidation; if still running, cancel it now (§6.6). Drop retention references; leased frames stay immutable and charged until their last lease releases.
3. Per-stream limit: an allocation that would pass `max_frames` fails that stream with `error` `stream.storage_exhausted` (G7); evicting other streams cannot help. The prefix and the error stay resumable until the stream expires.
4. Size pressure: when no free frame exists and `pool_bytes` cannot grow, invalidate streams from the old end of the queue, never the allocating stream, until enough unleased frames are free. A stream still being produced ends with `stream.gone` via §6.2 (Invalidate) and its upstream is cancelled; a finished stream is removed. Readers with a lease see the terminal error then end-of-stream. Never skip live bytes and continue a stream. Logical removal is not physical reclamation: leased frames stay immutable and charged until their last lease releases.
5. Retry the pending reservation only against actually free capacity, including growth by `fallocate` under `pool_bytes`. Owner ruling (G7): if stream, pool or metadata limits still prevent it, or `fallocate` returns ENOSPC, return an error and fail the allocating stream visibly with `error` `stream.storage_exhausted`; no heap fallback, no indefinite wait, provider failover, spill or degradation. A reader that never releases keeps its frames indefinitely; once the pool runs out, new allocations fail visibly too.

Full-snapshot egress pins its source range and can exhaust its stream quota. Allocation/mapping/file failures return 503 before commitment when possible; after commitment emit an error or close abnormally. OS mmap faults/OOM may kill the process: no guaranteed in-band error, signal-recovery subsystem or alternate pool.

### 6.5 Reclaim and memory accounting

An idle pool must give tmpfs pages back. The S0 benchmark measured four ways to punch holes (`FALLOC_FL_PUNCH_HOLE`); only decay reclaim kept the request path at heap parity:

| Reclaim | Result against heap |
| --- | --- |
| None | Parity, but the pool keeps its high-water mark (641 MiB stayed after ten 64 MiB streams ended). |
| Eager, on every free | -97% req/s at 64 tasks: each punch zaps PTEs in a shared mapping and sends TLB-shootdown IPIs to every CPU running the process. |
| Watermark, inside the free path | +132% (256 streams) and +408% (1024 streams) wall time. |
| **Decay, background tick** | Parity or faster in every row except one that is still open (§9.3); tmpfs fell from 641 to 1 MiB about one second after the streams ended. |

Decay is the rule above the configured startup reserve. A background tick runs once per second and punches the non-reserve frames that stayed idle on a free list for the whole interval. The fixed physical startup prefix remains backed whether allocated or free; punching it would discard the owner-approved warm budget and restore cold admission after idle. Beyond that prefix, decay keeps 8 free frames per free list as one pool-wide budget, wherever they sit, so frames one thread freed stay warm for the thread that steals them; it coalesces neighbouring free frames into one call. The request path never punches. The tick holds the cold-list lock across the punch; without it, frames in flight sit on no list and a stream that fills the pool fails early. A thread taking a punched frame prefaults the pages it writes (§6.1); prefaulting removed a +16% TTFB p99 regression with four readers, and limiting the first record to its own pages keeps small streams from populating 13 pages for one. The thread populates the frame after releasing the cold-list lock; a refused frame returns to the cold list. This reserve policy does not change the §9.3 memory acceptance limits; measurements must report a failing row rather than exclude the reserve from accounting.
Since 50,000 is not page-aligned, only whole pages inside a run of free frames are punched. An isolated frame keeps up to one partial page at each edge, so the residue grows with the page size: 8 KiB with 4 KiB pages, the page size of the S0 host; hosts with 16 or 64 KiB pages (some arm64 kernels) are unmeasured. The measured residue after decay on that host was 1-2 MiB. Record the page size with every memory result (§9.2). Each tick still sends TLB-shootdown IPIs to the CPUs running the process; the cost on hosts with many more busy threads is unmeasured.
Accounting: mapped tmpfs pages count as `RssShmem` inside `VmRSS`, as `shmem` in the cgroup's `memory.stat` and `memory.current`, and in `statvfs` on the tmpfs. They do not appear as `RssFile`. Monitoring and memory limits must read these, not `RssAnon` alone; a full pool puts `VmRSS` at about `pool_bytes`.

### 6.6 Client disconnect and resume

Owner ruling (Settled 42, 2026-11-14): a disconnected client must be able to reconnect and continue reading. The behavior below is mandatory. Phase A fixes the **S1 choice** of mechanism in §6.7; it does not change the S0 retention rulings.

- **Disconnect does nothing to the stream.** It closes the connection and releases that reader's lease. It does not cancel upstream, publish `cancelled`, invalidate the stream or free a frame. Collection continues until the upstream terminal event, or until the stream expires or is evicted (§6.4), whichever comes first; every byte stays in the cache queue meanwhile.
- **What removes a stream.** Only the 1 h no-read expiry and least-recent-read eviction (§6.4).
- **Quiet attached readers stay live.** Attach and each wait refresh last-read time; an outstanding wait continues to count as reading without new events. Expiry applies after the last reader disconnects and no read occurs for 1 h. Size-pressure eviction still applies while connected, and explicit cancel/shutdown still stops production.
- **What still cancels upstream.** A client's explicit cancel control where the protocol has one (`client_cancel`: the `response.cancel` and close controls in §4 and §5.7), `shutdown`, expiry or eviction while upstream is still running (readers receive `error` `stream.gone`, not `cancelled`; §6.2), the per-stream limit and the other G7 limit errors, and an upstream error. A non-streaming client request is a client stream too: its upstream call also runs to the end after a disconnect, and its bytes stay cached.
- **Resume.** The client presents the header-only stream identity and a cursor defined in §6.7. The egress index maps the cursor to internal sequence and intra-unit offset; the event index resolves that sequence to a `Position` (§6.1).
- **Resumed delivery.** A new reader attaches without a new routing attempt. It receives every retained record after the presented position in order, with no gap and no repeat, then follows the stream live while upstream is still being collected, or ends with the stored terminal record (`done`, `error` or `cancelled`) when it is finished. Resume neither fails over nor restarts the request.
- **Authorization.** The stream id is unguessable and a resume is accepted only for the identity that created the stream. Any other identity receives the same error as an absent stream.
- **Failure is visible.** A stream that expired, was evicted, never existed or belongs to another identity fails resume with `error` code `stream.gone`, status 410, scope `resource`. The gateway never answers with empty success or restarts content. Every reader attached at invalidation receives that error once, then EOF, without reading the invalidated backlog (§6.2). A position beyond committed end is a client 400.
- **Readers pin frames.** Invalidation never overwrites leased frames (§6.1, §6.4), even after the reader detaches and expiry later removes retention.

### 6.7 S1 resume API and cursor discovery

These are implementation contracts, not endpoints available in the Phase A tree. Resume uses the retained destination codec, operation, output options and creating identity. A resume request cannot replace them, select a model/provider, create a routing attempt or add usage.

**Identity and authorization.** Generate an unguessable, process-local ID from at least 128 random bits. Send it only in `X-Ck-Stream-Id`, never in a URL, SSE ID, JSON payload, WS subprotocol or cookie. It is distinct from provider response/call IDs and internal `X.stream_id`. On ordinary HTTP responses, expose it at the first-deliverable-byte commitment point, with no earlier success headers. For WS, issue it in the upgrade response for the retained session; the transport upgrade does not commit any inference turn. For WebRTC, issue it with the SDP response. Each subsequent turn stays bound to that session and retains its own attempt and quota.

Authenticate every attachment using the creating client identity, including its existing ephemeral-session scope where applicable. The ID alone grants no access. Perform authorization before cursor lookup. Unknown, foreign, expired and evicted IDs return the same 410 `stream.gone` response. Missing or duplicate identity headers, malformed cursors, incompatible cursor kinds and positions past published egress output return 400 after authentication; invalid credentials follow the existing authentication boundary. A body or query parameter cannot supply a missing ID.

Redact `X-Ck-Stream-Id` case-insensitively in request/access logs and request/response capture before formatting or spooling. Redact `Last-Event-ID` as well; it carries a resume cursor even though it carries no identity. Do not forward gateway resume headers upstream. Supplied clients keep IDs only in memory, never localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB or script-readable cookies. Native EventSource/WebSocket APIs cannot carry arbitrary request headers or expose WS response headers. Browser integrations use the Fetch attachment below, not URL tokens or an unspecified header-injection proxy.

**Attachment.** `GET /v1/streams?after=<cursor>` attaches a reader. Send the ID in the `X-Ck-Stream-Id` request header and ordinary authentication headers. For SSE only, `Last-Event-ID` may replace `after`; if both appear they must agree. Omission of both is 400, not an implicit restart. Return 200 with the retained content type, `Cache-Control: no-store`, `X-Ck-Stream-Id` and `X-Ck-Stream-Cursor` containing the accepted starting cursor. WS attachments upgrade this same route and return 101. Neither form sends a fresh provider request. Ordinary HTTP reconnects need no original request body.

For browser duplex integrations, the original session GET route also accepts `Accept: application/x-ck-stream` without a WS upgrade. It returns the session identity in the response header and streams length-delimited destination messages. Each record is one kind byte (`1` text, `2` binary, `3` cursor/control), an unsigned 32-bit big-endian payload length, then that payload. Payloads remain the retained destination codec's messages, not internal SSE. Reconnect uses Fetch GET `/v1/streams?after=<cursor>` with the same Accept header and header-only identity. POST `/v1/streams` sends numbered request-direction records or transport controls to that retained session and returns its accepted request cursor in `X-Ck-Stream-Cursor`; it never creates a session. Use the same framing for POST bodies. Admit complete units only, bound each record by the exchange quota, and keep incomplete input in mapped scratch. This is a boundary encoding for header-capable browser delivery, not a second inference pipeline. WebRTC clients may submit `x_ck.transport.offer` through this POST and receive the answer through their attached control stream.

**Cursor grammar.** Cursors contain positions only, never identity. Decimal components are unsigned 64-bit integers with checked parsing. `v1.e.<n>` means the client consumed the first `n` complete egress units; `v1.b.<n>` means it consumed the first `n` encoded entity-body bytes. Zero is the explicit beginning. Resume sends the suffix after that prefix. Event units are complete SSE records, WS messages or reconstructed media packets, not internal events or network fragments. `X-Ck-Stream-Cursor` advertises the zero cursor on the initial response and the accepted cursor on reattachment.

The egress index maps each unit to internal `seq`, output ordinal and mapped start/end positions. Byte cursors additionally map to an intra-unit byte offset. One internal event may emit zero, one or many units. Suppressed events consume no external unit number. Internal SSE IDs still equal `X.seq`; external SSE IDs use `v1.e.<n>` after the corresponding output unit. Preserve native upstream IDs in provenance. Deterministic re-encoding fixes synthesized identities, timestamps, framing and output options for the retained stream. Rebuild encoder state from positions; never retain a second heap output log. Indexes, retained encoded spans and reconstruction scratch share the exchange quota.

| Surface | Cursor discovery and acknowledgment | Reconnect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SSE, including image and Gemini SSE | Read `id: v1.e.<n>` only after a complete event. Discard a partial event on disconnect. | GET with `after` or `Last-Event-ID`; deliver the next whole event. |
| Buffered JSON: Chat, Messages, Responses, Interactions, legacy, count, compact, image results, video jobs and alpha search | Initial header advertises `v1.b.0`. Count entity-body bytes accepted by the client, including JSON framing. Keep the prefix until the document is complete. | GET with `v1.b.<received>`; append the exact suffix to the retained prefix, not to a newly parsed document. |
| Non-SSE Gemini JSON/array streams | Use byte cursors and retain partial JSON tokens and array framing. | Same byte-suffix GET; no extra opening bracket or repeated element. |
| Raw speech, finite video downloads, multipart or other binary HTTP output, SDP answers | Use byte cursors over encoded entity-body bytes, not decoded media bytes or HTTP chunk framing. | Same byte-suffix GET; do not issue a new media generation, job request or call. |
| Responses WS, realtime/Live WS and sideband, AI Studio relay JSON/binary messages | Each complete outbound unit is followed by `{"type":"x_ck.cursor","direction":"response","after":"v1.e.<n>"}` on the ordered channel. The marker acknowledges the preceding unit, carries no stream ID and is not an inference unit. | Upgrade GET with header ID and `after`. Reattach to retained turn/session state and follow live output. No replayed `response.create` or provider session creation. |
| WebRTC data-channel messages | Same marker on the reliable ordered data channel. | Upgrade GET with header ID and `after`; exchange `x_ck.transport.offer` / `x_ck.transport.answer` JSON messages containing `sdp` for a new client-facing peer only. Resume the retained upstream session. |
| WebRTC audio/video packets | Reliable data-channel cursor records add `track_id` and `packet_id` from §4. Advance only through the contiguous prefix of packets actually received; retain later packet IDs to suppress duplicates during replay. | Same client-peer negotiation. Replay cached packet bytes/timestamps in order before live packets; no direct-media fallback. Requires `media-relay`. |

For ordered WS, Fetch and data-channel delivery, clients apply a unit only when its following cursor marker arrives. If the connection dies between the two, discard that pending unit and resume from the previous marker. Packet delivery uses the explicit packet correlation above because media and control channels can arrive in different orders. HTTP byte delivery, both initial and resumed, uses identity content encoding; byte counts exclude transfer framing and remain stable across connections. Complete units and their markers are reconstructed from retained positions, not network write-success counters.

Duplex request-direction units have a separate accepted-prefix cursor, starting at `v1.e.0`. The receiver emits the same `x_ck.cursor` control with `direction: request` after storing and validating a complete unit; admission of a turn still waits for `request.end`. On attachment, the gateway reports that accepted prefix before accepting new input. A sender discards acknowledged units and resends only its unacknowledged suffix. Each unit is preceded by `{"type":"x_ck.input","unit":1,"direction":"request"}`, with consecutive unit numbers starting at 1. Duplicate unit numbers already accepted are acknowledged without execution; gaps fail before admission with HTTP 400 or a bounded transport error after upgrade. These boundary controls carry no stream IDs and never become trusted internal `x_ck` fields. The AI Studio relay applies the same rule with producer/consumer roles reversed; reconnect does not resubmit an accepted browser inference request.

An abnormal socket loss releases a reader, not a producer. Explicit `response.cancel`, session-close and hangup controls still stop their owned work. Resume replays the stored terminal outcome once; a cursor at the end of retained output after the terminal was delivered receives EOF without another terminal. A cursor beyond the retained end returns 400 under the cursor validation above. An active cursor at the published end waits for publication. No client acknowledgment frees cached response frames or updates accounting. Reads and acknowledgment advances refresh recency as in §6.4.

Acceptance must cover zero-output events, one-to-many output, partial JSON/base64/byte units, concurrent readers, both duplex directions and a lost cursor marker. Terminal-cursor acceptance includes both cases:

- A cursor at the end of retained output after the terminal was delivered receives EOF without a repeated terminal.
- A cursor beyond the retained end returns 400, not EOF.

Disconnect before the initial identity header is received cannot be resumed by that client; collection still follows §6.6. Test wrong identities, future cursors, expiry/eviction, explicit cancel, shutdown and case-varied headers through logging/capture/spooling. Verify no ID reaches a URL or client persistent storage.

## 7. Bounds and flow

| Boundary/state | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Ordinary event exceeds limit | Client 413 for oversized input; upstream error for oversized output; never silently truncate. |
| Invalid textual UTF-8/JSON | Client 400; upstream terminal error; no replacement-character repair or raw passthrough. Binary media remains valid arbitrary bytes. |
| Partial input record | Hold only mapped spans up to event/stream limits; timer-flush custom data; ordinary incomplete JSON is not published. |
| Slow consumer | Keep reading upstream into the cache queue (D2); buffered bytes stay charged and follow the 1 h no-read expiry and least-recent-read eviction like any entry; the per-stream limit fails the stream visibly; never an unbounded queue. |
| Stream frame/cache limit | Apply §6.4: the per-stream limit fails that stream visibly; pool pressure evicts the stream read least recently and the 1 h expiry removes idle ones, each ending attached readers with `error` `stream.gone`; no resource-exhaustion provider failover. |
| Cancellation | Explicit client cancel, shutdown, expiry, eviction and limit errors cancel upstream HTTP/WS/media I/O and cooperative work, stop producers and wake readers; outstanding leases obey §6.4, never forced reuse or retry. Expiry and eviction end readers with `error` `stream.gone`, not `cancelled`. |
| Client disconnect | Release only that reader's lease. Upstream collection continues and the bytes stay cached for a resume (§6.6); a resume after expiry or eviction fails with `stream.gone`. |
| Pre-delivery upstream failure | Routing may retry another permitted upstream/credential with a fresh attempt stream; do not mix failed-attempt events into the selected response. |
| First deliverable event | Egress sets commit once before scheduling the first output bytes; status/headers become fixed; retry is disabled. |
| Post-delivery failure | Preserve delivered prefix, emit destination error/abnormal close, never append successful terminal output or restart content. |
| Non-streaming client | Egress reads position-backed events into the destination document incrementally; only final output serialization waits for completion. |
| Streaming terminal snapshots | Egress re-reads retained ranges for Responses item/output snapshots and similar formats; no accumulated heap copies. |

Request and response retention together must fit their assigned stream budget; an unlimited-duration stream is not unlimited retained history.
Keep request-direction and scratch ranges only while an egress snapshot or reader needs them; release them promptly after their last dependent position advances. A response stream's ranges stay in the cache queue for resume and snapshots (§6.4).
Where a final response requires old content, do not evict it silently to meet a limit; fail visibly under the same queue rule.
A destination that only accepts whole tool JSON may delay tool serialization at egress by reading mapped fragments; internal argument delivery remains incremental.
SSE, JSON array streams, raw media HTTP bodies, WS JSON/binary messages and WebRTC packets are egress encodings, not alternate internal pipelines.
Today `crates/ck-server/src/inference/dispatch.rs:1644-1680` bootstraps `Done::Stream` on the first nonempty upstream chunk and concatenates non-streaming output in `BytesMut`; bootstrap is not transport commitment.
Configured nonstream/media keepalives can commit headers/body before an inference event (`crates/ck-server/src/inference/dispatch.rs:463-468`).
The new single commit point is egress scheduling the first client-deliverable bytes after encoding; suppressed metadata cannot commit, and pre-delivery keepalives/success headers are forbidden (§3.6).
Today's framer has a 16 MiB per-event default and a BytesMut buffer (`crates/ck-translate/src/sse.rs:9-13,28-34`); that number is evidence, not an adopted S0 stream/pool limit.

## 8. Extension

Plugins are deleted (owner ruling 2026-11-13, 「目前完全删除外挂功能，如果用户想要拓展功能，需要修改源码并自行编译部署」). There is no runtime plugin, interceptor, SDK or ABI boundary. Extending cooker means changing the source and rebuilding.
Every stage that reads or rewrites stream content is in-process code. It follows the §3 grammar, the §6.2 publication protocol and the §6.4 quotas, and cannot change trusted request identity, attempt ownership, usage authority or commitment state.

## 9. Verification

### 9.1 Golden change ledger and semantic assertions

For each changed fixture, record fixture ID, affected route/direction/mode, old behavior, new behavior, ruling/spec clause, and replacement semantic assertions in [STREAM-GOLDEN-CHANGES.md](STREAM-GOLDEN-CHANGES.md). Its Phase A inventory is an acceptance input, not a list of passing S1 tests.
Do not bless rewritten expected bytes wholesale. Keep exact-byte checks only where bytes remain contractual, such as decoded media and opaque signature content.
Replace obsolete pair-registry/wiring assertions; same-protocol re-encoding is not a reason to retain legacy translators.
The ledger MUST explicitly replace invalid-UTF-8 passthrough and single-buffered-tool-chunk expectations (`crates/ck-translate/tests/golden.rs:550-583,588-612`).
Cover every registered client/upstream combination and applicable request/stream/buffered/count mode; the current registry has 30 arms in `crates/ck-translate/src/lib.rs:283-315`. Add native same-protocol, compact, all media and duplex routes listed in the ledger inventory.

| Assertion group | Required semantic proof |
| --- | --- |
| Text/order | Every text/thinking part survives in source order, including several same-kind Gemini parts, empty strings and interleaved choices. |
| Replay | Claude fragmented signatures, redacted thinking, Gemini signature-only parts and Responses encrypted items round-trip to the correct history block. |
| Tools | Start/fragments/end remain incremental; IDs and choices survive; historical JSON input stays structured until Chat egress serializes it, while custom text remains text. |
| Usage | Partial/repeated/corrected snapshots, explicit zero/absent/null, cache TTL buckets and multiple attempts count once; count_tokens never becomes generation usage. |
| Fidelity | Choice-scoped `delta: {}` logprobs-only chunks need no fabricated text; refusal/safety/citation offsets and provider sequences survive; unknown nested fields/events reach egress before destination-specific emission/debug-logged drop. |
| Request fields | Both sampling fields, audio modalities, legacy options, speech instructions and provider options survive. Late unsupported mapped semantics cause 400 with zero upstream requests; Typed content/controls round-trip; literal media-marker look-alikes remain data, references cannot cross streams. |
| Destination projections | Choice 0 selected by index, not array position; dropped choices and unsupported B9 events produce content-free debug diagnostics. |
| Framing | Fragment every UTF-8/SSE delimiter/base64 unit across reads; exercise multiline data, CR/LF variants, empty events and source terminal markers. |
| Failures | Client invalid UTF-8→400; upstream invalid UTF-8/malformed/truncated input→error; no success after error/cancel or post-terminal content. |
| Commitment | Metadata-only output that egress suppresses permits retry; deliverable role/event bytes prevent it; keepalive cannot commit early. |
| Media | Exact bytes/MIME/timing, 36,864-byte full chunks, whole encoded event ≤50,000 bytes, framing overflow shortens the chunk; ≤100 ms collection while allocation succeeds, including a slow consumer; failed reservation ends with error. |
| Duplex | Responses append/history and realtime control/media/sideband preserve direction/turn/session/packet identity; cancellation closes owned work. |
| Storage | Concurrent publication exposes complete prefixes; cross-block JSON, lost-wakeup races, cancellation, stale handles and frame reuse cannot leak/corrupt content. A frame held by a reader is never reused or punched. |
| Bounds | Exercise a throttled client against a fast upstream (upstream reads never pause; the 5,369th frame fails with the 256 MiB per-stream error), least-recent-read eviction excluding the allocator, concurrent readers with distinct cursors and independent pins, and every attached reader receiving Gone once then EOF. With a test clock, attachment and pending waits refresh recency, quiet attached readers survive beyond 1 h, disconnected/unread streams expire after 1 h, and writes do not refresh them. Shutdown/eviction racing append and reservation rollback must release frames exactly once; a pinned lease survives invalidation and forces visible exhaustion rather than overwrite or heap growth. |
| Resume | Disconnect a client mid-stream: upstream is not cancelled, collection reaches `done`, and the bytes stay cached. Reconnect with the last delivered position: delivery continues with no gap and no repeat, live while upstream runs and from the cache after it ended. Resume after expiry (test clock), after eviction and from another identity returns `stream.gone` (410), never an empty success or a restart. Explicit cancel, expiry, eviction and a limit error still cancel upstream. |
| Permissions/lifecycle | Real private mmap pool on tmpfs and configured disk directory; modes, unlink, process death and last-reader release verified. Pool exhaustion on a small tmpfs returns an error (ENOSPC from `fallocate`), never SIGBUS. |
| Loss ledger | L01–L18 receive consumer-visible regression coverage where applicable; no test merely greps source or repeats implementation wiring. |

Checked growth ENOSPC evidence comes from the ignored `pool::tests::isolated_tmpfs_growth_and_cold_prefault_enospc` test on a disposable private 4 MiB tmpfs and the isolated `pool enospc` G-storage workload. Ordinary `cargo test`/nextest skips that test and is not growth-ENOSPC evidence. Phase F must retain the isolated-test and gate results; red G-storage rows remain a blocker before master, not a reason to relax thresholds.

New gates require planted violations and a recorded failing result: erase a signature, replace absent usage with zero, overwrite a Gemini part, publish before event completion, reuse a leased frame, bypass chunk timer/size, commit on suppressed metadata, cancel upstream on client disconnect, or leave the last-read time unrefreshed by a read.
Use deterministic clocks and local mock upstreams; concurrency/storage checks use real temporary mappings and isolated process lifetimes, not fake success adapters.
No live-provider traffic without owner approval. Cache-semantic changes require warm/changed-context/idle checks with observed cache read/write usage (`crates/AGENTS.md`, Performance and Verification).

### 9.2 Benchmarks and metrics

Maintainers replace the provisional §6.4 defaults with measured values from §9 and record each value and its measurement in this specification and `docs/BENCHMARKS.md`. Choose a regression tolerance before the run: completing a benchmark is not passing an unchosen tolerance.
Use old/new release binaries separately, identical host/configuration/CPU affinity/load, three alternating old/new rounds for the codec, pipeline and flow measurements below, fresh server processes and isolated loopback mocks. The storage rows in §9.3 set their own run counts, and those gate the S1 merge.
The following are commands for implementation verification, not commands run while writing S0; OLD/NEW/OLD_LATENCY/NEW_LATENCY are existing build paths and OUT is a disposable output directory.

```sh
for round in 1 2 3; do
  SERVERS=rust SCENARIOS='chat chat-stream chat-stream-slow messages-stream' \
    bench/run.sh "$OLD" "$OLD" "$OUT/old-$round" 1
  SERVERS=rust SCENARIOS='chat chat-stream chat-stream-slow messages-stream' \
    bench/run.sh "$NEW" "$NEW" "$OUT/new-$round" 1
  MIN=1000000 MAX=3000000 DELAY=0ms \
    bench/messages.sh "$OUT/messages-$round" old "$OLD"
  MIN=1000000 MAX=3000000 DELAY=0ms \
    bench/messages.sh "$OUT/messages-$round" new "$NEW"
  bench/latency.sh "$OUT/latency-old-$round.jsonl" "$OLD_LATENCY"
  bench/latency.sh "$OUT/latency-new-$round.jsonl" "$NEW_LATENCY"
done

`bench/run.sh` resolves its second binary argument even for SERVERS=rust, so repeat the Rust path there; it is not a Go comparison (`bench/run.sh:30-33,155-157`).
Scenario names and current measures are in `bench/run.sh:120-151`; Messages MIN/MAX/DELAY and affinity are in `bench/messages.sh:40-51,96-110`; latency arguments/isolation are in `bench/latency.sh:5-28`.
The current `chat-stream-slow` scenario delays the upstream, not the downstream consumer (`bench/run.sh:121-130`); additionally run an explicitly throttled downstream reader to prove upstream collection continues (D2) and the per-stream limit fails visibly.
Latency harness peak memory includes proxy, mock and client (`crates/ck-server/examples/claude_latency.rs:7-28`); report it separately from proxy-only measures.

| Measurement | Required dimensions |
| --- | --- |
| Codec cost | CPU ns/event, allocations/event, allocated bytes/event, encoded/decoded bytes/event; each protocol/direction and event kind. |
| Pipeline cost | CPU/completion, throughput, TTFB/time-to-first-deliverable-event, inter-event delay, completion latency and p50/p95/p99. |
| Memory/storage | Heap peak/retained bytes, RSS/PSS, anonymous versus mapped/shmem resident bytes, pool reserved/used frames, metadata bytes, page faults and tmpfs/cgroup charge. |
| Flow limits | Consumer lag, blocked-read duration, cache bytes, time since last read, evictions, expiries, resumes and `stream.gone` count, allocation failures, cancelled-stream cleanup and outstanding leases. |
| Media/long streams | Signatures, tool fragments, logprobs, multiple choices, audio/video chunks, long-lived realtime, completed-output snapshots and actual slow consumers. |
| Small requests | Few-KB requests, pool startup/mapping cost separately from steady-state frame allocation; no per-request pool-file cost assumed. |

Record host architecture/page size, kernel, filesystem, CPU affinity/load, build flags, configuration, binaries/revisions, repetitions and raw results.
A lower heap/RSS reading alone is not a memory improvement claim: account for mmap/tmpfs residency and OS page cache; compare total charged resources under the same workload.

#### S1 benchmark interfaces and pending inputs

Run from the repository root on Linux with release builds, Python, Go, curl, jq, taskset and working user/network/mount namespaces. `$TMPFS` names an existing private tmpfs directory. `$OUT` names external disposable output on a no-snapshot filesystem. These interfaces are frozen for later phases; Phase A does not implement or run them.

| Interface | Implemented by | Required result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `bench/stream-gate.sh "$TMPFS" "$OUT/storage"` | Phase B | Exercise production `ck-stream` against same-layout 50,000-byte heap frames. Run every §9.3 row, including 250 MiB, 101 alternating runs for the open row, memory decay, total cap and isolated ENOSPC. |
| `bench/codec-gate.sh "$OLD_CODEC" "$NEW_CODEC" "$OUT/codecs"` | Phase C | Compare equivalent external fixture workloads through all four boundary roles, not old pair APIs. Three alternating old/new rounds; report every codec metric above per protocol, direction and event kind. |
| `bench/flow-gate.sh "$NEW" "$OUT/flow"` | Phases D/E | Local upstreams and genuinely throttled clients; disconnect/live/completed resume, signatures, tools, logprobs, choices, long realtime/media and terminal snapshots. Record upstream progress independently of client progress. |
| Existing `run.sh`, `messages.sh`, `latency.sh` commands above | Phases D/F | Three alternating old/new rounds with final configuration and private pool setup. Separate proxy-only memory from the combined latency process. |
| `bench/container-start.sh cooker:ci "$OUT/container-start"` | Phase F | Start the actual runtime image, await `/healthz` with `{"status":"ok"}`, check pool initialization and modes, then shut down and remove disposable resources. |

Each new driver exits nonzero on a missing workload, missing metric, invalid input or failed threshold. Write raw per-run records and a summary under its output directory. Record workload/fixture IDs, revision, binary checksum, compiler/profile/features/build flags, host/page size/kernel/filesystem, configuration, affinity/load, round and units. No aggregate may hide a failed row. Flow-only new capabilities have semantic/limit gates; do not invent an old resume baseline.

The container gate uses image `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/cooker-runtime`, uid/gid 10001, a fresh private `/data` volume and `--tmpfs /run/cooker-runtime:rw,noexec,nosuid,size=512m,mode=0700,uid=10001,gid=10001`. Check the created `cooker/` directory is 0700 and the pool is 0600. Also check missing XDG without an explicit directory fails, an unsafe directory is refused, and an explicit private directory works without XDG. A valid capped pool below 256 MiB must start with derived `max_frames`; an explicit value above `pool_frames` must fail. Rootless containers only. Version output alone is not startup proof.

Phase A captured the old release gateway and the `bench/latency.sh` executable from post-W1 `b518060ea1e43ef4b266591986ca92321e6289b5`. Maintainer-held artifact directory: `/home/zakk/code/jev-router/p4/s1-baseline/`, outside the repository, not a public download location. Preserve these files separately from new builds.

| Artifact in that directory | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- |
| `cooker-b518060e` | `4f89bd8e13abd3078adea569b7c61805b2a2f5d366219e4ae24883b28ea7a9fc` |
| `claude_latency-b518060e` | `9f5fecbebb3b411f60292a2d2b72a3aeaf9a88e521ac3d9add4f76a564cc0d79` |

Build provenance: `rustc 1.99.0 (b940084d7 2026-09-28)`, LLVM 23.1.1, `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`; `--locked --release -j 8`, thin LTO, one codegen unit, `strip = true`, no explicit feature flags or custom Rust/compiler/linker environment flags. Gateway features are empty; the latency example enables `ck-server/testing` through its dev self-dependency. Neither enables `media-relay` or `pprof`. The absent `ui/dist` was built first with `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` and `npm run build`. Host: AMD Ryzen 9 9950X3D (16 cores / 32 threads), Linux `7.3.4-gentoo-cjk-zakk`, 4,096-byte pages, inherited CPU affinity 0-31. Build-start/end 1/5/15-minute load averages were 1.77 / 1.92 / 2.26 and 19.65 / 13.26 / 6.71. The isolated `/scratch/ssd/s1a-old` worktree and `/scratch/ssd/s1a-old-target` were removed after copying. `STREAM-GOLDEN-CHANGES.md`, Old baseline build provenance, records exact commands, sizes, compiler commit and the retained `fix-baseline-*` logs. This captures executables, not performance acceptance.

Pending acceptance inputs, not Phase A results:

- The Phase C codec comparison harness over equivalent old/new fixtures. The pinned `ck-translate` has no standalone codec benchmark executable; the captured gateway and latency example do not substitute for one.
- Matching new release executables and adapted configuration/load harnesses. Do not overwrite old artifacts with new builds.
- Same-host baseline/load records and raw rounds using the owner-approved tolerances below before performance acceptance.
- Measurements for initial extent/growth (21 frames each is a hypothesis), header-slot capacity, heap headroom and provisional event/metadata limits. No measured value is claimed here.

#### Codec and pipeline tolerances

Owner ruling (2026-11-14 morning, option B): each codec/pipeline metric permits at most 5% regression; memory and storage permit none. For each comparable workload, compare the median of three old and three new rounds. Each round reports its own p50/p95/p99; compare matching percentiles across rounds. Do not pool unrelated protocols, directions, modes or body sizes.

| Metric | Acceptance rule |
| --- | --- |
| Codec CPU ns/event, allocations/event | New median no higher than 1.05 × old median (at most 5% regression). |
| Pipeline CPU/completion, first-deliverable, inter-event and completion latency p50/p95/p99 | New median no higher than 1.05 × old median (at most 5% regression). |
| Throughput | New median no lower than 0.95 × old median (at most 5% regression). |
| Allocated bytes/event, heap peak/retained and total charged memory/storage | New median no higher than old median (0% regression) for equal work and retention. Report retained-cache cost separately from old disconnect cleanup; never call that unequal-lifetime comparison a pass. |
| Flow, media and semantic correctness | No missing data, duplicate accounting, early commitment, upstream pause or limit/timer violation. These are mandatory contracts, not noise tolerances. |

Zero old values require zero new values; use absolute values, not division by zero. Measurements outside a rule fail; the 5% allowance already accounts for noise and grants no further waiver. Encoded byte counts may change with the grammar and are reported, not compared as byte-exact goldens. Exact decoded media and signature bytes remain contractual. These tolerances do not relax §9.3, including its unresolved 101-run row, or the existing size, idle and request-heap budgets in `REQUIREMENTS.md`.

### 9.3 Storage regression gate (S1)

Owner ruling (G9): performance tests mount the storage directory on tmpfs, and no regression against heap buffering is accepted. S1 may not merge the pool until every row below holds. The comparison is the chosen pool backend (per-thread LIFO lists, 128-byte alignment, decay reclaim) against heap frames of the same size and layout, on the same host, with `stream.pool_directory` on tmpfs. The per-request-file backend was rejected (§6.1) and is not measured here.
**S1 choice:** use at least 7 alternating runs per row and compare medians. A row regresses when the pool's median is worse than heap's and falls outside heap's own min..max range. The open row below uses a stricter rule.

| Row | Workload | Measured | Pool must be |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Small request | 2 KiB (32 × 64 B), create, write, read, drop; 1 task and 64 tasks; req/s, p50, p99 | 64 tasks: +2.5% req/s, p99 -19%; 1 task: -0.4% req/s, p99 +7.2% (other runs -1.3%, within noise) | Not slower than heap |
| Concurrent streams | 256 and 1024 streams of 256 KiB in 256 B deltas, 1 reader each; wall time and TTFB p99 | 256: -18% wall; 1024: -40% wall; TTFB p99 -27% in both | Not slower than heap |
| Throughput | 1 writer, 1 and 4 readers, 64 B and 48 KiB appends, streams of 1, 32 and 250 MiB; MB/s. 250 MiB is the largest size that fits the per-stream limit of 5,368 frames when each 48 KiB append takes one frame (5,334 frames); the limit is not raised | S0 ran 256 MiB streams with a raised limit: +2% to +121% except the open row below. The 250 MiB rerun is pending | Not slower than heap |
| Latency | 64 B deltas 20 µs apart, 1 and 4 readers; append-to-observe p50 and p99; TTFB | p50 equal; p99 +4% with 1 reader (inside heap's range), -21% with 4 readers | Not slower than heap |
| Memory | 100 × 1 MiB and 10 × 64 MiB held, then released (expired with the test clock for the pool); `VmRSS`, `RssAnon`, `RssShmem`, cgroup `memory.current`, tmpfs used; sampled after the first eligible reclaim tick, at most two decay intervals after the release, because frames freed just after a tick are not yet idle for a full interval at the next one (§6.5) | Sampled about 1 s after release: 100 × 1 MiB: `VmRSS` 3 MiB and tmpfs 2 MiB against heap's 17 MiB `VmRSS`; 10 × 64 MiB: 2 and 1 MiB against heap's 2 MiB | `VmRSS` at or below heap's, and tmpfs used and `VmRSS` each at most 4 MiB over the pre-test baseline, plus 8 frames for each free list; the run uses 8 worker threads, so the allowance is 8 × 8 × 50,000 = 3,200,000 bytes |
| Total-budget exhaustion | 4 GiB pool on a tmpfs with at least 4 GiB free, 256 MiB per stream, every stream held by an active reader lease so nothing is evictable: each stream is capped at 5,368 frames (§6.4), and streams append until refused | Not measured with these quotas. The S0 `totalcap` run used 512 MiB streams of 10,738 frames; rerun it with 5,368. Sixteen streams hold 85,888 of 85,899 frames | Streams 1-16 stop at the per-stream limit; stream 17 stops at the total cap after at most 11 frames; each refusal is an error, no SIGBUS, no heap spill |
| Tmpfs exhaustion (ENOSPC) | Private tmpfs of 64 MiB (`unshare -Urm`), growth by `fallocate` | ENOSPC returned after 66,158,592 committed bytes; the same run grown by `ftruncate` died of SIGBUS | `fallocate` error becomes a stream error, no SIGBUS, no heap spill, process keeps running |

The 4 MiB memory margin sits just above the 1-3 MiB the S0 run reported, which is MiB-granular and varies between runs, and far below the residue of a failed reclaim (112 and 641 MiB). The 8-frame term is the free frames each list keeps by design (§6.5).

For an explicit startup reserve, the maintainer's 2026-11-14 interpretation of option B adds `startup_reserve_bytes` to the memory comparison budgets: RSS/tmpfs must stay within the pre-open baseline plus the configured reserve plus the existing allowance; the RSS comparison against heap also includes that fixed resident budget. Report raw charges without subtracting the reserve, and do not punch its protected frames. Reserve zero leaves every original threshold unchanged. The ordinary gate uses that zero default; explicit-reserve diagnostics must record both the raw charges and the reserve-inclusive limits.

One row is open: 4 readers, 64 B appends, 1 MiB streams. It does not pass by default. S0 results over 101 repetitions: the decay pool's median was +0.4% and -2.9% in two runs, the fixed pool without reclaim -4.1% and -3.7%, and heap's own runs spread from 254 to 1320 MB/s. The harness could not attribute or remove the possible few-percent loss. S1 runs this row for the pool and for heap, 101 alternating runs each, and reports both medians and the difference. Heap's run-to-run spread is the interquartile range of its 101 runs (P25..P75). The row passes only when the pool's median is not below heap's P25; a median below it blocks the merge until fixed or until an owner accepts the loss.
The S0 prototype `s0-bench` (outside this repository) produced the numbers. S1 ports these workloads into `bench/` and keeps the gate there. Commands used, from the prototype directory with `$TMPFS` an existing tmpfs directory (the S0 `rss` rows ran the `pool-fixed+reclaim` backend, which is the chosen decay pool; `totalcap` must first be changed to give each stream 5,368 frames):

```sh
cargo build --release
sh scripts/run-all.sh "$TMPFS/s0-bench"        # about 7 min; includes the ENOSPC check
sh scripts/followup.sh "$TMPFS/s0-bench"       # padded LIFO pool, decay reclaim; about 1 min

## 10. Accepted defaults

Every default below is binding for S1 and **Settled (default accepted 2026-11-14)**. The cache numbers (G8: 256 MiB per stream, 4 GiB total, 1 h since last read) and the resume behaviour (§6.6) are owner rulings of 2026-11-14. Owners directed implementation to proceed, not to wait for another design approval; a later owner ruling may still revise a row. Where this spec is silent, follow the keeper behaviour at the commit pinned in §2, "Further details".

| Default | Status |
| --- | --- |
| B1: Claude block-bound signatures | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.2–3.3). |
| B2: opaque redacted-thinking event | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.3). |
| B3: Gemini part-bound/signature-only parts | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.2). |
| B4: TTL buckets, absence, usage snapshots | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.5). |
| B5: choice-level logprobs | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.1). |
| B6: media MIME/bytes/transcript/timing | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.4). |
| B7: independent choices, choice-0 projection | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.7). |
| B8: tool start/deltas/end | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.3, §3.6). |
| B9: grounding/code/URL events and egress drops | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.7). |
| C2: invalid-text UTF-8 failures | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§7). |
| D1: event and metadata sizes | Revisable by a later owner ruling; maintainers replace the provisional values with measured ones after the §9 benchmarks (§6.4). |
| D3: first-deliverable-byte commit | Revisable by a later owner ruling (§3.6, §7). |
| F: codec and pipeline thresholds | Revisable by a later owner ruling; maintainers set throughput, latency, CPU, allocation and total-storage tolerances after the baseline and before accepting performance (§9). |

Linux-only scope, one representation, the storage rulings in §2 and visible resource failure remain owner decisions, not pending design questions.
